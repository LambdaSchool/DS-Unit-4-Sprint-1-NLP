# DS-Unit-4-Sprint-2-NLP

**Natural Language Processing**

A particularly common unstructured data is the sort of information you are consuming right now - natural language, in written or spoken form.

Human language is a fascinating phenomenon and powerful expressive tool, but despite the many rules of grammar language is not a fully defined deterministic system in the same way that programming languages (like Python) are. Language can be thought of as semi-structured, but even the structure it has (nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.) can be difficult to recognize. Most humans are fluent in one or more languages, but even that fluency doesn’t mean they can explicitly list or consciously understand the “rules” they are following.

Nonetheless, human language is the main form of content on the Internet (and beyond), and the ability to computationally process it at scale can lead to many compelling products. A brand may want to track the sentiment of users towards them on social media before/after an advertising campaign, or a news service may want to recognize key entities in a news story to generate a high-quality automated summary. But text is not numbers - and even representing it as e.g. ASCII/Unicode values doesn’t capture the meaning, just the abstract labeling of symbols. How can we hope to achieve these sorts of tasks?

In this sprint we will learn assorted NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques - many involving cleaning and preprocessing, which can then allow us to feed the data into the more traditional statistical models we are familiar with. There are also more advanced specialized models that are particularly conducive to NLP which we will address.
