    "Your goal in this assignment: find the attributes of the best & worst coffee shops in the dataset. The text is fairly raw: dates in the review, extra words in the `star_rating` column, etc. You'll probably want to clean that stuff up for a better analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the corpus of text using text visualizations of token frequency. Try cleaning the data as much as possible. Try the following techniques: \n",
    "- Lemmatization\n",
    "- Custom stopword removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the attributes of good tokens. Once you have a solid baseline, layer in the star rating in your visualization(s). Key part of this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions. There should be plenty of markdown cells! :coffee:"

For coffee I typically get the Moonraker or wintermoon. Both are the perfect cold drink and that moon milk...like liquid crack.  I also like their ground coffee and use it for home brewing because the flavor a are not harsh like other coffees  The breakfast burrito I had was the bacon and cactus burrito, which I was hesitant about, but it was perfect. The cactus was like a bell pepper so it wasn't too crazy.  This is just an amazing coffee shop in a very unassuming location, but to pass it up would be a shame. Amazing wood fired coffee</td>\n",

Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the cheesecake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the gelato is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather pay $4 for a delicious gelato here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back!</td>\n",

Their beer selection does not beat Whip-In's, but it is still far and beyond any other store of its scale in town.  The guys working there are always friendly and knowledgable about what the store sells.  They genuinely seem to take pride in what the store offers, and are happy to see you walking through the door appreciating it.  I don't know if they are owners of the joint or not, but that says a lot nowadays.    Their sandwiches, while not stellar, are pretty good.

They have a homemade pickle infused vodka, which I must say I was iffy about, but it was AMAZING.  To make the bloody mary even better they have a bloody mary bar where you can add any garnish you wish...and boy did I add everything offered!

       "1640   6/15/2015 1 check-in I love coming here every time I'm in Austin. The coffee is amazing of course but even their breakfast burritos were great.  For coffee I typically get the Moonraker or wintermoon. Both are the perfect cold drink and that moon milk...like liquid crack.  I also like their ground coffee and use it for home brewing because the flavor a are not harsh like other coffees  The breakfast burrito I had was the bacon and cactus burrito, which I was hesitant about, but it was perfect. The cactus was like a bell pepper so it wasn't too crazy.  This is just an amazing coffee shop in a very unassuming location, but to pass it up would be a shame. Amazing wood fired coffee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "949    7/30/2016 1 check-in I had a small sized gelato, half cherry and half pistachio.  Gelato was nice and smooth. Pistachio tasted like real pistachios, just as it should and was not overly sweet. It was very good.  The cherry was lovely. Again, not too sweet and a bit of tartness from the pieces of cherry.  It also had a sort of jelly/jam like topping as they scoop it, which had a slight tart/sourness to it. I sampled the cheesecake and passion fruit, both were delicious. Small size is perfect because the gelato is rich and flavourful. Very friendly service and the pricing is right.  I'd much rather pay $4 for a delicious gelato here, than $7-8 for gimmicky ice cream you can get at other places. I'll be back!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "3626   8/18/2016 I am more so reviewing the place in it's entirety. The food isn't great but it's better than expected for coffeeshop food. But the atmosphere and the darling outdoor seating on the front porch is what brings me back. There is a good amount of indoor seating and a ton outdoor. It's a great place to come early on a weekend morning (not past 10, it gets crazy busy), have good coffee, and enjoy the weather. Also a great place to grab a drink with a friend (less busy at night) and sit on the porch -- I did this recently when it was raining, and it was beautiful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",

       "610    4/13/2016 I have struggled to find good coffee around where I stay, which is 25 min North of downtown. Life is really hard without access to good coffee, especially that I sometimes work from home. All the highly rated cafes around my place were all disappointments.  Guess suburb population tends to appreciate yummy sugary coffee flavored milkshake way more than real coffee.  In Austin, Houndstooth was my favorite , but a bit far from mine and it's N. Lamar location does not have enough tables for work. I am so please to find Two Hands, and now I go there every weekend for work, even though it still takes me 15 minutes to get there. The coffee is spot on. The cappuccino and expresso macchiato are both well made, with the right temperature and good quality beans, allowing the expresso taste shine through the foaming milk. Nice staff. Yummy pastry. (Macaroon is my fav! Ask them to heat up!) good space for work.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "89     7/19/2016 1 check-in Quaint coffee house, kind of feels like your friend's living room. It's dimly lit and isn't air conditioned as well as other cafes in the area so it was only semi comfortable for me to get some work done.  The coffee is good, downside is they only had a few baked goods when I went so if you're hungry you should check out the food trucks in the nearby area before/after your coffee!  The barista was not very friendly which was a surprise to me. On the plus side they were playing the format the entire time I visited which was super nostalgic :):)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "1550   11/10/2014 1 check-in I love this place. The baristas are pleasant, the coffee is excellent, the space itself is so cute!  Their iced toddy is great. It's one of my go-to drinks to get me through the day. Their espresso beverages are perfectly executed, from milk texture and temperature to beautiful pours. This place as made me a believer in Tweed. They also have a lovely pastry selection that includes vegan options!  I love the ambience and light the room gets in the early mornings. It's such a romantic shop. I typically don't use coffee shops as an office/workspace and really enjoy just having coffee and a good conversation. Parking is limited, but I've always been lucky enough to find a spot very near the shop! A great local shop I am very happy to support.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "7409   7/14/2009 Listed in My Neighborhood Bad news first: This goods this place sells are VERY marked-up.  You can expect to pay a bit more for just about everything than anywhere else.    OK, now that that is out of the way, I can tell you why, despite the cost, I can't seem to stop myself from going in there every day.    The quality and variety of the stuff they offer is amazing.  You won't just find ice cream here, you'll find organic goat's milk ice cream.  you won't just find soap here, you'll find all-natural locally made soap.  The list goes on and on.  Their beer selection does not beat Whip-In's, but it is still far and beyond any other store of its scale in town.  The guys working there are always friendly and knowledgable about what the store sells.  They genuinely seem to take pride in what the store offers, and are happy to see you walking through the door appreciating it.  I don't know if they are owners of the joint or not, but that says a lot nowadays.    Their sandwiches, while not stellar, are pretty good.  In fact, I'm heading over there now to grab a six pack and a ruben! Live Oak Market during their lunch rush.    \n",
       "2479   5/2/2016 Shout out to Santiago for paying it forward! Last week my friend Lindsay invited me to meet her for coffee as I was leaving the gym. I didn't have my wallet with me as I was planning on simply going to and from working out. She said she got me except for when it was time to pay, her card only allowed for payment of half of the total! She was having \"bank issues\" so could not transfer any money either. Santiago turned a slightly embarrassing moment into an act of kindness by telling her not to worry about the rest. He did not act annoyed nor cancel the order & even went to the back to grab us some stickers we asked for with the order. Way to go on the customer service front! Will definitely remember this and be back (with my wallet ;-)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "4844   11/21/2016 1 check-in This place gets a 5 star for simply having the best bloody mary.  We went for brunch and I planned on just having a tea.  Of course, my husband looked at me in disgust and said \"what do you mean just a tea?'  (we were on vacation and it was odd for me not to get alcohol with every meal) so I snapped out of it and said you're right make that a bloody mary and I am so thankful I did. They have a homemade pickle infused vodka, which I must say I was iffy about, but it was AMAZING.  To make the bloody mary even better they have a bloody mary bar where you can add any garnish you wish...and boy did I add everything offered!  As far as brunch goes, the food was great and the atmosphere was nice (don't let the front of the building deter you).  Definitely give this place a try!

       "      <td>11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul</td>\n",

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul</td>\n",

When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place.

Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "2      11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul    \n",

       "5      11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere!

       "7611   2/19/2015 I actually step into this restaurant by chance and now is one of my favorites in Austin. I ordered Budha Bowl Java Bowl, Hummus and a couple of teas. I really liked Budha Bowl, the black rice specially, and the best of all that it was super gentle with my stomach and digestion, I felt happy. The Java Bowl was also ok, although the chicken it had was cold and I'm not a fan of cold chicken. This plate came with a sauce that was actually good. I think the best one I tried on the different restaurants I visited while in Austin. This restaurant specializes on teas. And they have really good ones. I ordered Moroccan and Raspberry Iced.
