    "Your goal in this assignment: find the attributes of the best & worst coffee shops in the dataset. The text is fairly raw: dates in the review, extra words in the `star_rating` column, etc. You'll probably want to clean that stuff up for a better analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the corpus of text using text visualizations of token frequency. Try cleaning the data as much as possible. Try the following techniques: \n",
    "- Lemmatization\n",
    "- Custom stopword removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the attributes of good tokens. Once you have a solid baseline, layer in the star rating in your visualization(s). Key part of this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions. There should be plenty of markdown cells! :coffee:"

       "0   11/25/2016 1 check-in Love love loved the atmosphere! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha latte, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot.

It's not really in the city, but it's worth the extra five minutes for a very comfortable cup of your favorite coffee.  First and foremost, they've got some of the best espresso machines you can buy.   They look like they came from Metropolis.  They're coffee beans are roasted outside of Houston at the original Lola Savannah (which I believe is the owner's mother's place).  The baristas care about coffee and making it correctly which seems to be a fabled myth in the corporate coffee world we are surrounded by.  They're always playin' good music, the seating is spacious and very comfy and they have really good breakfast tacos and pastries.  Oh, and they're connected to The Grove so you can enjoy that great wine selection.  Serious recommendation from a fairly serious Yelper.</td>\n",

They also have a beer and wine selection ($1 off on Mondays-Fridays from 4-7!) The staff are super friendly and keep everything really organized and clean.  I love coming here to study. It's the perfect mix of people who come here to study and socialize so there's always a quiet background buzz. There are big store front windows which let in natural light and makes the place seem very open even when it gets crowded during lunchtime rushes when people swing by to grab a cup of coffee on the go. They also have a small collection of games you can play if you need a study break or just want to play games (bananagrams, jenga, and chess, to name a few). Green tea tropical iced tea</td>\n",

This place gets mad props for several reasons:  open mic nights, coffee AND beer, super pet friendly.  And super helpful (and cute) counter staff.  The seating area inside isn't the largest or roomiest but the backyard more than makes up for it.  Like the vibe of Fair Bean-maybe not the coffee house vibe for everyone-but a breath of fresh air for those of us tired of pretentious cups of joe.  4 out of 5 stars and I can't wait to go back.

It's everything hot chocolate should be. It's rich without being overpowering and it's smooth. The raspberry Italian soda is also pretty tasty - it's light and refreshing and I imagine it would be quite good on a hot summer's day. I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on their coffee drinks.  The atmosphere is very open. I feel like I can have a quiet conversation here and no one will care, but I can also come here to get work done, if necessary. The upstairs seems to be a quieter spot to allow for more focused working while the downstairs lounge and bar offers a better setting for conversation.  You order at the counter in the back and pick up your drinks at the bar in the center. They also have a rewards card - for every ten drinks you buy, you get one free. I don't have a rewards card, but my friend does and he makes great use of it.  Now that I'm no longer a student, I have little reason to visit coffee shops except for meeting friends. My friend really enjoys coming here since he is still a student, and sometimes I get to tag along. (Gotta get out of the house sometime, you know?)  Parking can be tricky since it's downtown, so I recommend walking, taking the bus, or riding your bike. Parking isn't impossible, but depending on what's going on downtown on any given night, it can be a pain. (I don't mind since I enjoy walking downtown, but I know that's not for everyone.)  I'm not a coffee shop connoisseur, but this place is welcoming, the drinks are good, and the service is excellent. Hot chocolate</td>\n",

Standard default 15% tip on the ipad of course (dude!  can i tip you negative 15%???).  Then after being rude, she tells us to go sit down with our number on the table and they will bring us \"everything\" at once.  After 20 min, we're thinking how long can coffee and shakes take?  Turns out the coffee was just sitting on the counter getting cold.  And they pretty much forgot about the sandwiches we suspect b/c the 2nd girl asked what else we ordered other than the drinks.  She was at least friendly about it though so I\"ll give her credit.    Drinks and food were maybe average.  Nice spot to sit on the deck, but not sure it's worth it if you're going to order anything other than a drip coffee.  Anything more complicated and you better be patient , and not care about the rude girl taking your order.  I think we spent about $70 for several people, so it's not like the place is cheap either.

These normally laid back, down-to-earth folks noses go straight into the air in regards to coffee.  They have been known to shriek things such as, \"No, no you can't do that!!!!  You will bruise the beans!!!\"  Or \"Ooooh noooo, we don't DO flavored coffee,\" with a look of disdain.  They cringe at the thought of buying pre-ground beans and they lament the fact that their car's cup holders don't accommodate the carafe (yes carafe) of freshly brewed coffee that travels with them everywhere they go.  Pretentious much?  I'd say so.    Something else they are adamant about is buying their coffee from Anderson's.  As a kid, weekend activities such as softball games, birthday parties, and Girl Scout campouts were scheduled around trips to Anderson's (they are closed on Sundays so we had to make it on a Saturday, even if it was a very busy Saturday).  You would think growing up in this environment, some coffee knowledge would have seeped through to me, but nope, I don't even know how to brew a cup.  In fact, I'm quite intimidated by coffee and shy away from coffee shops.  I get nervous trying to order, afraid that I'll make some mistake.    One day I realized I needed to buy some coffee because I had house guests coming.  I went straight to Anderson's, and though I had some anxiety about ordering the wrong thing, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and best of all, not the least bit pretentious (ahem, mom &amp; dad!).  Walking in the door, it smells absolutely divine and there are all sorts of little knick-knacks.    Quite simply, the best coffee in Austin.  I just hope I don't come across as high falutin now when I say, \"Oh, I only get my coffee from Anderson's.\"</td>\n",

I was glad that the lady was willing to provide a few samples for me since I hadn't been there before. I ordered from the vegan side, which is all Coconut Bliss coconut milk ice cream. Ordered a half and half scoop, which was awesome, since I didn't want to do two scoops just to get two flavors. Not all places are that accommodating.  They'd already put the baked goods away, which seems like poor business to me. My brother, who goes frequently, said that's common practice for them to empty out the bakery case hours before closing. The woman said if there was anything we wanted, she could get it from the back, but it's hard to know what I want if I can't see it: the texture, the size, the potential for deliciousness entreating me to spend more money. I hope they'll reconsider this practice in the future.  Also of note: loyalty cards. My brother got a punch for each of us, and I got mint chocolate chip. Score.</td>\n",

Something is always a hit or a miss.  For example, I got the new sea salt Thai tea recently and absolutely loved it - sweet, creamy, but also strong flavor of tea. I raved about how good it was to a friend and she ordered it a week later, and the drink was way too milky and nothing like what I ordered.  Today, I got boba milk tea - a classic and one of my favorite drinks here, and even at first glance, I knew something was off. The color was so dark and it was so watered down. What's worse is the drink was full of tea leaves in every sip. I had to ask them to make a new one, which the barista kindly did. However, the drink still tasted watered down without the creamy taste I remember. This isn't the first time this has happened, and I don't imagine it will be the last.  I know their receipt says that they will remake any drink if it's not satisfactory, but when the milk tea is made in large quantities in advance, there's not much the barista can do. Is it my bad that I keep ordering it, thinking that the third, fourth, fifth time will be the charm? I don't know. But one thing for sure is the need for consistency/quality control. Please, please make sure all the baristas make drinks the same way! :(</td>\n",

       "1276   11/12/2016 Good place for drinking a mocha and  hanging out with friends and maybe light work on-the-go.

       "1066   10/15/2014 4 check-ins That area needed a good coffeehouse and this was it. I was sick and tired of going to a coffeehouse which I'm going to name but I'll give you a hint - they have private events scheduled and they will kick you out of the room. Then you have to fend for yourself. I didn't want to go to Starbucks either. It's a nice area with old school furniture and there are board games.  Their coffee hits the spot. If I'm in the area, this is where I'm going to get some good coffee.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "3935   6/3/2012 Lola Savannah's got me licking my lips more than LL Cool J in the 90's!!  This is by far my favorite coffee shop in Austin!  It's not really in the city, but it's worth the extra five minutes for a very comfortable cup of your favorite coffee.  First and foremost, they've got some of the best espresso machines you can buy.   They look like they came from Metropolis.  They're coffee beans are roasted outside of Houston at the original Lola Savannah (which I believe is the owner's mother's place).  The baristas care about coffee and making it correctly which seems to be a fabled myth in the corporate coffee world we are surrounded by.  They're always playin' good music, the seating is spacious and very comfy and they have really good breakfast tacos and pastries.  Oh, and they're connected to The Grove so you can enjoy that great wine selection.  Serious recommendation from a fairly serious Yelper.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "557    4/29/2016 4 check-ins So I don't know much about coffee, but their drip coffee is good enough to drink black. Their beans are fair trade, so that's also a plus if you're into that. They also have a beer and wine selection ($1 off on Mondays-Fridays from 4-7!) The staff are super friendly and keep everything really organized and clean.  I love coming here to study. It's the perfect mix of people who come here to study and socialize so there's always a quiet background buzz. There are big store front windows which let in natural light and makes the place seem very open even when it gets crowded during lunchtime rushes when people swing by to grab a cup of coffee on the go. They also have a small collection of games you can play if you need a study break or just want to play games (bananagrams, jenga, and chess, to name a few).

       "4267   9/9/2009 2 check-ins Listed in Best drinking (coffee and/or adult) Irie Bean Coffee Bar  A relatively new place in my rotating selection of coffee houses.  This place gets mad props for several reasons:  open mic nights, coffee AND beer, super pet friendly.  And super helpful (and cute) counter staff.  The seating area inside isn't the largest or roomiest but the backyard more than makes up for it.  Like the vibe of Fair Bean-maybe not the coffee house vibe for everyone-but a breath of fresh air for those of us tired of pretentious cups of joe.  4 out of 5 stars and I can't wait to go back.

       "2501   3/27/2013 1 check-in Listed in 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge, The best part of waking up is Cuvée in your cup! Caffé Medici, you're pretty cute.  I really like their hot chocolate. It's everything hot chocolate should be. It's rich without being overpowering and it's smooth. The raspberry Italian soda is also pretty tasty - it's light and refreshing and I imagine it would be quite good on a hot summer's day. I don't drink coffee, so I can't comment on their coffee drinks.  The atmosphere is very open. I feel like I can have a quiet conversation here and no one will care, but I can also come here to get work done, if necessary. The upstairs seems to be a quieter spot to allow for more focused working while the downstairs lounge and bar offers a better setting for conversation.  You order at the counter in the back and pick up your drinks at the bar in the center. They also have a rewards card - for every ten drinks you buy, you get one free. I don't have a rewards card, but my friend does and he makes great use of it.  Now that I'm no longer a student, I have little reason to visit coffee shops except for meeting friends. My friend really enjoys coming here since he is still a student, and sometimes I get to tag along. (Gotta get out of the house sometime, you know?)  Parking can be tricky since it's downtown, so I recommend walking, taking the bus, or riding your bike. Parking isn't impossible, but depending on what's going on downtown on any given night, it can be a pain. (I don't mind since I enjoy walking downtown, but I know that's not for everyone.)  I'm not a coffee shop connoisseur, but this place is welcoming, the drinks are good, and the service is excellent.

       "6758   2/14/2015 If you care at all about getting friendly and somewhat fast service, then this place is not for you.  The girl at the counter taking orders was obnoxious.  Standard default 15% tip on the ipad of course (dude!  can i tip you negative 15%???).  Then after being rude, she tells us to go sit down with our number on the table and they will bring us \"everything\" at once.  After 20 min, we're thinking how long can coffee and shakes take?  Turns out the coffee was just sitting on the counter getting cold.  And they pretty much forgot about the sandwiches we suspect b/c the 2nd girl asked what else we ordered other than the drinks.  She was at least friendly about it though so I\"ll give her credit.    Drinks and food were maybe average.  Nice spot to sit on the deck, but not sure it's worth it if you're going to order anything other than a drip coffee.  Anything more complicated and you better be patient , and not care about the rude girl taking your order.  I think we spent about $70 for several people, so it's not like the place is cheap either.  Probably would rather go sit outside at Trio if we want to drop the $                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "2378   4/8/2010 Listed in Yelp=Therapy Let me be upfront about something: I don't drink coffee.    But I have a very close relationship with two of the world's biggest coffee snobs.  These normally laid back, down-to-earth folks noses go straight into the air in regards to coffee.  They have been known to shriek things such as, \"No, no you can't do that!!!!  You will bruise the beans!!!\"  Or \"Ooooh noooo, we don't DO flavored coffee,\" with a look of disdain.  They cringe at the thought of buying pre-ground beans and they lament the fact that their car's cup holders don't accommodate the carafe (yes carafe) of freshly brewed coffee that travels with them everywhere they go.  Pretentious much?  I'd say so.    Something else they are adamant about is buying their coffee from Anderson's.  As a kid, weekend activities such as softball games, birthday parties, and Girl Scout campouts were scheduled around trips to Anderson's (they are closed on Sundays so we had to make it on a Saturday, even if it was a very busy Saturday).  You would think growing up in this environment, some coffee knowledge would have seeped through to me, but nope, I don't even know how to brew a cup.  In fact, I'm quite intimidated by coffee and shy away from coffee shops.  I get nervous trying to order, afraid that I'll make some mistake.    One day I realized I needed to buy some coffee because I had house guests coming.  I went straight to Anderson's, and though I had some anxiety about ordering the wrong thing, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and best of all, not the least bit pretentious (ahem, mom & dad!).  Walking in the door, it smells absolutely divine and there are all sorts of little knick-knacks.    Quite simply, the best coffee in Austin.  I just hope I don't come across as high falutin now when I say, \"Oh, I only get my coffee from Anderson's.\"    \n",
       "1721   12/29/2015 Pretty adorable little spot in an albeit unsuspecting location. We stopped here the other night for some vegan ice cream after dinner. I was glad that the lady was willing to provide a few samples for me since I hadn't been there before. I ordered from the vegan side, which is all Coconut Bliss coconut milk ice cream. Ordered a half and half scoop, which was awesome, since I didn't want to do two scoops just to get two flavors. Not all places are that accommodating.  They'd already put the baked goods away, which seems like poor business to me. My brother, who goes frequently, said that's common practice for them to empty out the bakery case hours before closing. The woman said if there was anything we wanted, she could get it from the back, but it's hard to know what I want if I can't see it: the texture, the size, the potential for deliciousness entreating me to spend more money. I hope they'll reconsider this practice in the future.  Also of note: loyalty cards. My brother got a punch for each of us, and I got mint chocolate chip. Score.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "4395   11/19/2016 Updated review 7 check-ins Listed in Austin Coffee I want to love Tea Haus as much as I did when it first opened, but it's so hard..I never know what I'm going to get when I come here. Something is always a hit or a miss.  For example, I got the new sea salt Thai tea recently and absolutely loved it - sweet, creamy, but also strong flavor of tea. I raved about how good it was to a friend and she ordered it a week later, and the drink was way too milky and nothing like what I ordered.  Today, I got boba milk tea - a classic and one of my favorite drinks here, and even at first glance, I knew something was off. The color was so dark and it was so watered down. What's worse is the drink was full of tea leaves in every sip. I had to ask them to make a new one, which the barista kindly did. However, the drink still tasted watered down without the creamy taste I remember. This isn't the first time this has happened, and I don't imagine it will be the last.  I know their receipt says that they will remake any drink if it's not satisfactory, but when the milk tea is made in large quantities in advance, there's not much the barista can do. Is it my bad that I keep ordering it, thinking that the third, fourth, fifth time will be the charm? I don't know. But one thing for sure is the need for consistency/quality control.

       "6820   2/22/2015 Excellent gelato and coffee. This place really serves excellent products, but the atmosphere is really lacking. It gets 5 stars for its gelato and coffee but 2 for atmosphere. If they would just provide comfortable seating, use softer lighting, do some redecorating, and play some some music, this place would be fantastic.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul</td>\n",

       "      <td>11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul</td>\n",

From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere! Viva matcha latte and Cortado</td>\n",

       "0      11/25/2016 1 check-in Love love loved the atmosphere! Every corner of the coffee shop had its own style, and there were swings!!! I ordered the matcha latte, and it was muy fantastico! Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

But, will probably be back just to be somewhere unique and nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "2      11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul    \n",

I loved their computerized user friendly ordering system, it made it easy me to pick & choose all the items I wanted to try. I ordered pop tart, chicken & waffles, strawberry waffles (photos uploaded). This place is ideal for ordering a few dishes to share with your group. Seating is limited since this place is fairly new with lots of visitors. Arrive early and be prepared to wait a bit if you with a large grop.

       "5      11/20/2016 1 check-in Very cute cafe! I think from the moment I stepped in, there really wasn't anything I didn't find cute at The Factory. From their decor to their cups, everything was really cute. It's really the perfect place for a catching up with friends or a coffee date.  When you go order, there's really the least amount of interaction ever with the workers. You just pick your order on an iPad and they'll call your order out after for you to pick up at the counter. The whole thing's pretty novel honestly. I got the Viva Matcha Latte and it was so good! Perfect amount of sweetness and perfect temperature. I went on a cold night and this cafe is just so cozy, it was such a great combination. They have these swings as well which were pretty fun to sit on honestly.  Prices are what I would expect for a cafe like this, not super cheap, but not too pricey. There's no wifi here, so if you want to study, maybe this isn't the right place. But overall, very nice atmosphere!

       "7611   2/19/2015 I actually step into this restaurant by chance and now is one of my favorites in Austin. I ordered Budha Bowl Java Bowl, Hummus and a couple of teas. I really liked Budha Bowl, the black rice specially, and the best of all that it was super gentle with my stomach and digestion, I felt happy. The Java Bowl was also ok, although the chicken it had was cold and I'm not a fan of cold chicken. This plate came with a sauce that was actually good. I think the best one I tried on the different restaurants I visited while in Austin. This restaurant specializes on teas. And they have really good ones. I ordered Moroccan and Raspberry Iced.

I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul</td>\n",

Ordering and getting my drink were pretty streamlined. I ordered on an iPad, which included all beverage selections that ranged from coffee to wine, desired level of sweetness, and a checkout system. I got my latte within minutes!  I was hoping for a typical heart or feather on my latte, but found myself listing out all the possibilities of what the art may be. Any ideas?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "2   11/30/2016 1 check-in Listed in Brunch Spots I loved the eclectic and homey plush decor and who doesn't want to swing and drink their coffee?  I would categorize this as a pricier coffee place but, to me it was worth it.  After Thanksgiving nobody wants to make brunch so we headed out in search of chicken and waffles.  There is ample parking in the private lot and  ordering is done through I-Pads.  Pick a seat and they will call your name when your items are ready.  Be patient because some of the coffee drinks take longer than others.  I had the cold brew coffee, chicken and waffles and we shared a pop+art!  The po+art was strawberry; light and fluffy on the outside and gooey sweet filling on the inside.  The chicken and waffles wasn't the standard so expect different, complex and interesting flavors from the accompanying slaw and sauce.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but, the waffle was a bit bland and maybe could have used a bit of honey to spruce it up.  The coffee here is spot on and I hear that their hot chocolate is the bomb but, I will have to wait for the weather to cool off to try that.  A great place to be cozy and chat with your friends, a date or read a book. Chicken and waffles Pop tart Coffee See all photos from Carmela S. for The Factory - Cafe With a Soul    \n",
