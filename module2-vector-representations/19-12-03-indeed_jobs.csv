About BP:
BP's BPX Energy business (formerly known as the Lower 48) operates across a vast US geography, from Texas north through the Rocky Mountains. The business manages a diverse portfolio which includes an extensive unconventional resource base of about 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent across 5.5 million gross acres in some of the largest and most well-known basins in the US. Headquartered in Denver (Colorado), BPX Energy employs about 1,700 people across six states, operates more than 9,600 producing wells and has 70,000 royalty owners. Our vision is to be the premier, high return, onshore exploration and production company that consistently increases asset value. Our Wyoming operations are anchored on the giant Wamsutter tight gas field in the south central part of the state. In the San Juan area of Colorado and New Mexico we produce from tight gas sands and operate the largest coal-bed methane field in the US. Our Mid-Continent operations cover the prolific Anadarko, and is home to the famed East Texas basin, along with the Woodford shale gas play and Arkoma basin. We also have non-operating interests in over 10,000 wells across the US with substantial positions in both the Eagle Ford and Fayetteville shale basins.

CIRES/NOAA PSD Post-Doc in Machine Learning for Improved Weather Forecasts,University of Colorado Boulder,"Job Summary
The skill of weather forecasts has improved steadily over the past four decades as the results of better forecasting models, better and more numerous observations, more efficient use of observations through data assimilation, and more refined after-the-fact correction of forecasts based on historical errors. Machine learning techniques, exploiting the explosive growth of knowledge, tools, and software, are now the basis for many corrections. The University of Colorado’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) and the Physical Sciences Division (PSD) at the NOAA Earth System Research Lab in scenic Boulder, Colorado, seeks an enthusiastic and capable Postdoc to help us tighten up this loop and use machine learning to make forecasts that require less correction.

The Postdoc will work with world leaders in data assimilation and ensemble forecasting to improve forecasts by machine-learning short-term forecast error and forecast uncertainty, with the aim of applying those error corrections in-line to improve ensemble forecasts. The requirement to improve probabilistic forecasts - not only the average error but the chaotic variability - makes this an especially challenging and exciting application. This is a real-world application: the project will use NOAA’s next-generation global forecasting system. Our group is tightly linked to the National Weather Service and effective corrections could be affecting national weather forecasts within a few years.
Who We Are
At CIRES, the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences, more than 800 environmental scientists work to understand the dynamic Earth system, including people’s relationship with the planet. CIRES is a partnership of NOAA and the University of Colorado Boulder, and our areas of expertise include weather and climate, changes at the Earth’s poles, air quality and atmospheric chemistry, water resources, and solid Earth sciences. Our vision is to be instrumental in ensuring a sustainable future environment by advancing scientific and societal understanding of the Earth system.
Physical Sciences Division website:
https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/
What Your Key Responsibilities Will Be
The Postdoctoral researcher will work with NOAA and CIRES scientists at PSD to develop machine learning corrections for ensemble forecasts with NOAA’s prototype global weather forecasting system. Tasks will include replaying the forecasts model against operational analyses on high-performance computing systems to develop a long history of incremental analysis updates, using machine learning to predict the analysis corrections based on the model state, and assessing the degree to which probabilistic forecast skill can be improved by applying the corrections.
What You Should Know
The project is funded for two years with some possibility for extensions.
CIRES commits to inclusive excellence by advancing equity and diversity in all that we do. We are an Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity employer, and particularly encourage applications from members of historically underrepresented racial/ethnic groups, women, individuals with disabilities, veterans, LGBTQ community members, and others who demonstrate the ability to help us achieve our vision of a diverse and inclusive community.
This position will be rostered in CIRES at the University of Colorado Boulder, but will be physically situated in the David Skaggs Research Center, 325 Broadway, Boulder, CO 80305. If you are the selected finalist you will be required to pass a federal laboratory background clearance for site access.
What We Can Offer
We can offer a competitive salary, commensurate with experience, along with a generous benefits package.
Benefits
