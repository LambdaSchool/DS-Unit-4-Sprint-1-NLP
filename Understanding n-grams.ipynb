The idea is to let users control the ad delivery, and even to allow users to comment on ads. 27,,2001 The Merchants of Cool , a Frontline documentary featuring Mindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff, is on PBS tonight. Check your local listings for the time. 26,,2001 ATMs dispensing music? I dont quite see the logic in that. Im not entirely against paying a nominal fee for music, or any other media, but if I do have to pay for it Id be much more likely to buy stuff from my own PC. 22,,2001 My chair started squeaking a few days ago and its driving me nuts! 20,,2001 The New York Press has a lenghty article about the post dotcom crash scene thats worth reading. 18,,2001 Francis Collins 10 Most Surprising Things About the Human Genome . 18,,2001 FILMSPEED has great movies you can download for free. The Third Man, in particular, is one of my favorite films of all time. 17,,2001 For sale: An STB nVidia ZX 8MB 3D Accelerator (AGP) and a 40X NEC CD-ROM drive. Interesting trades considered. 16,,2001 Ive started uploading stuff to my live365.com radio station. Theres not much there yet but youre welcome to listen . (cable/dsl or higher required) 14,,2001 FEEDs latest special issue is an excellent examination of video games , with contributions from Carl Steadman, Steven Johnson, Justin Hall and others. Dont miss it. 14,,2001 New DVD! The Maltese Falcon . 14,,2001 I once had a personal homepage, long before weblogs came into fashion, but never managed to update more than a couple of times a year. Heres hoping Ill be a bit more successful with this. Big thanks to Bopjet for hosting this and Mindjack . 31,,2001 The Register reports on \"war driving\" - the wireless equivalent of war dialing. Instead of having your modem dial into thousands of networks until you get in, you just drive within range of a wireless net with your wireless-equipped laptop and hack away. related: The latest issue of CIO has a great feature on wireless. 30,,2001 Short documentary on digital filmmaking and Star Wars Episode II. 27,,2001 Rumour has it that the parent companies of Inside.com and Brills Content will be announcing a merger as early as next Monday. Apparently the two print magazines would fold into one called Brills Inside Content and the two websites would form Media Central Inside.com . Rolls right off the tongue, doesnt it? 27,,2001 Destroy All Monsters - Survivor: Monster Island . My moneys on Mothra. 26,,2001 I just spent some time playing with the beta version of Atmosphere , Adobes new 3D environment software, and thought Id give a couple of quick impressions. Ive always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community. You could build all these really cool places but people couldnt interact in them. You also couldnt easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages. I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista?) but it didnt as far as we would have liked. Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems. Its not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance. 25,,2001 Thanks to Onebox.com I should now be able to receive faxes. Not suprisingly, they dont have local phone numbers for Fredericton so I chose a New York City area code. If anyone wants to give it a whirl, my number is: (212) 894-3748 x2690. 22,,2001 Well, I was supposed to be working. But, through a long trail of procrastination, I ended up redesigning this site. 21,,2001 Quotable Mindjack! From Mike Sugarbakers review of Lemon : \"If you have no patience for the lengthy ruminations of brilliant madmen, Lemon isnt for you. But you read Mindjack, so youre probably into that sort of thing, right?\" 13,,2001 Mindjack is featured in the links section of this months Netlife magazine . It doesnt seem to be online yet so heres a scan: 08,,2001 Well, the big Yahoo news yesterday was that Tim Koogle is stepping down as CEO and that theyll miss forecasts in the first quarter. Today the stock tumbled . 07,,2001 The Times reports that the Trogan Room Coffee Machine webcam is going offline for good later this year. That pot should go in a museum. 05,,2001 It looks like theres some big news due from Yahoo later today. 05,,2001 The new issue of Mindjack Magazine is now online, featuring a first for us - a live concert review. With original photos even. 29,,2001 Its not good when a box of Sinutab describes your day. Sinus pain, headache, congestion, itchy, watery eyes. Ugh. 24,,2001 The End of Free - chronicling the demise of free stuff on the net. 23,,2001 Im not sure I like the direction FEED just turned . \"The filter\", a new weblog linking to outside content is now featured more prominently than FEEDs original content. Its also not clear what the difference is between the filter and Plastic . 21,,2001 Hey now. Jon Lebkowsky has started a blog. Coolness and wisdom is to be found within. 21,,2001 What looks like the new PalmOS PDA from TRG looks mighty impressive. The official launch is rumored to be on Monday. If its priced reasonably enough it might get me to upgrade from my 512k PalmPilot Personal. 19,,2001 Stick figure fighting action like youve never seen before. 17,,2001 Evan Williams of Blogger has more on How the Trellix Deal Happened -- and What It Means . 16,,2001 Need a logo ? be a website ? Email me . I will work for toys . 15,,2001 It was just announced that Trellix is licensing Pyras Blogger technology , giving Pyra a much needed cash infusion. Dan Bricklin has a fascinating account of how the deal happened on his site. 14,,2001 I recently got the 12 Monkeys DVD , which is excellent. Its worth picking up just for the included feature-length documentary, The Hamster Factor and Other Tales of Twelve Monkeys , about the making of the film. 12,,2001 Redesigned again. 12,,2001 Inside.com reports that Economist business editor Chris Anderson has been named editor of Wired, replacing Katrina Heron. 11,,2001 The new issue of Digital Web Magazine is out today. Lots of interesting stuff. 10,,2001 This is one of the reasons Im a vegetarian. (washingtonpost.com) 06,,2001 Justins back from Japan with stories and pictures. 05,,2001 Something screwys going on with my computer. Things are crashing, my mouse is stuttering, MP3s are skipping when they didnt before, and sometimes it just slows to a crawl. Ive got a nagging feeling that Im going to have to do a complete format and reinstall Windows but I really dont want to do that. 03,,2001 Mikel.org pointed me to this rumor that Automatic Media is in trouble . Automatic is the company that consists of Feed, Suck and Plastic. Hopefully it is just a rumour. 03,,2001 Home of the Underdogs is an amazing resource for anyone that loves computer games. Not only do they have hundreds of games you can download which are no longer available from the companies, they also have a wealth of information about many of the games. Its not entirely legal, but I think its a great public service. Its even better now that they have one of my favorite games, Gabriel Knight . 02,,2001 Theres a great article by William Gibson in the The Observers Special Japan Issue . 02,,2001 We reinvented culture the way we wanted it - with great big shoes . David Bowie writes about glam in todays Guardian. 31,,2001 Its been a while since I played around with customizing My Yahoo! so I dont know how new this is, but you can now use themes in additoin to plain colors. 26,,2001 Streaming video from the Reboot conference , featuring Justin Hall, Dave Winer, Evan Williams, Douglas Rushkoff and others. Itll make ya think. 23,,2001 Mindjack is now in deep development mode and, through the magic of blogs, you can follow the action as it happens . 23,,2001 Shift is back with a design that looks vaguely familar . It looks good but those javascript scroll boxes are slooooow. 17,,2001 If I had heard Doves Lost Souls album last year, I would have included on my best of 2000 list . Hawksley Workmans (Last Night We Were) The Delicious Wolves will probably be on this years list. 16,,2001 CNET has video of Steve Jobs tour of Apples new retail stores. 15,,2001 Aint It Cool News has some great clips and pictures from the new Coen Brothers film, The Man Who Was Not There. Im excited. 13,,2001 Yet another redesign. I think Ill stick with this one for a while. 13,,2001 Sure, its advertising. But its damn good advertising. 11,,2001 DSL! 09,,2001 Feed has a great interview with Cory Doctorow today. The overlap between Doctorows day job at OpenCola and his night job writing fiction makes for a unique combination: Its almost like William Gibson launching a company that sells neural plugs and stim-sims. 01,,2001 Douglas Rushkoffs Frontline documentary, The Merchants of Cool is being rebroadcast tonight on PBS (check your local listings). Set your Tivo or VCR, or watch it as its on even. 01,,2001 Im DSLless for 10 days. I suppose compared to most other companies thats pretty snappy service, but its still 10 days without DSL. 08,,2001 FEED gave the official word today that theyre sutting down, at least for the foreseeable future. The same goes for Suck , although it looks like Plastic will be continuing for now. Both FEED and Suck have been online for six years, and have been excellent throughout. Hopefully they can pull out this funk and come back in one form or another in a few months. 05,,2001 Jason Kottke has some great pictures from the Louvre today. 02,,2001 Great roadtrip article by Mark Frauenfelder in One magazine. \"A half-century ago, the streets of Southern California were filled with flamboyant towers of consumerism -- spires and obelisks and beacons -- transmitting neon-fortified messages of optimism to families riding in cars with space-age tailfins. Life was good, and the marvels of modern science were making a world as new as tomorrow.\" 30,,2001 Bill Frisells latest album Blues Dream arrived in the mail today and it only confirmed what I suspected. I have got to get more Frisell. 26,,2001 blogdex is a spider that crawls blogs and generates a list of the most linked to sites. Ten bucks says blogdex itself is number one by tomorrow. 26,,2001 living dangerously I havent hotsynced my PalmPilot in a couple of months. How long can it go before craping out? Stay tuned. 23,,2001 This years Webzine conference in NYC looks like it went over well. We have coverage in the current issue of Mindjack . 21,,2001 Looking for some summer reading? Canadian Media Theorists: Canadian Media Resources . found via mikel.org 17,,2001 Ive been reading Boing Boing since before it was a weblog but I just noticed the links to Mark and Corys garage and flea market finds today. 03,,2001 Man. I uninstalled McAfee Viruscan and my computer seems twice as fast. Now, to find a virus scanner with less of a memory appetite. 03,,2001 Mindjack is back and theres more to come. 31,,2001 They dont make keyboards like this anymore. This is the Underwood Portable I mentioned the other day. 30,,2001 StarOffice 6 looks like it will be a big improvement over the current version. Ive been using StarOffice as an alternative to PowerPoint, but the sluggishness mentioned in this article has stopped me from using it regularly for much else. 28,,2001 Synapse is now offiicially open. Come and stop by. 27,,2001 Synapse is live! Almost. It will publicly launch late tonight, but were looking to get some conversations going before that. If youd like to help out go to synapse.mindjack.com and join now. 26,,2001 My copy of Words! Words! Words! arrived the other day. It is good. 26,,2001 I seem to have unintentionally started a typewriter collection. I was given an Underwood Portable Typewriter in near perfect condition yesterday. 25,,2001 More cool stuff.

Twenty Twenty : Astronomical Vision by Chris McKinstry \"Very early on a cold morning in 1979 I looked with one of my highly astigmatic eyes through my first professional telescope at a setting Jupiter. Even with my flawed vision, the long white metal tube so finely manufactured it could have been a piece of sophisticated medical equipment, let the cloud bands of our solar system’s largest planet and the bright points of a handful of its moons into my mind, making me feel a shadow of the shock that Galileo must have felt when he saw the same sight before any of us. \" 20,,2001 I redesigned Mindjack a bit. It should load quite a bit faster now, and look better at lower resolutions. New this week, Design for Community reviewed by David Brake. Next week, an interview with Derek Powazek. 17,,2001 The new Infinite Matrix is up with a long excerpt of Cory Doctorows new novel, Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom . The Liberty Square ad-hocs were the staunchest conservatives in the Magic Kingdom, preserving the wheezing technology in the face of a Park that changed almost daily. The newcomer/old-timers were on-side with the rest of the Park, had their support, and looked like they might make a successful go of it. 02,,2001 Im the top left corner on Cory Doctorows Four blogs on one page , which is one excuse why I havent been posting to this blog very much lately. Ill try to give myself a kick in the pants over the x-mas break and get this thing going again. 27,,2002 Wonderful gallery of Atari concept illustrations. via BoingBoing 21,,2002 I redesigned the Mindjack front page a bit to include the entire Daily Relay blog , rather than just excerpts. 20,,2002 denizen is a new weblog about classic gaming from the creator of Home of the Underdogs . 20,,2002 Now in Mindjack, a review of the Xircom Wireless LAN Module for Palm m500 handhelds. A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting. Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience. One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. Working on an airplane or from a café just felt wrong. This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If youve used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what Im talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you wont go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- Ive stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I cant choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all. And it keeps on getting better. 802.11 isnt just a technology, its a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If youre in a major city, chances are youll find one before you go a block. Forget 3G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control. 16,,2002 Mindjack T-shirts are now available . These are high-quality, genuine screenprinted shirts, not the Cafe Press stuff. Thanks Brunetto ! If youre looking to get some shirts printed I highly recommend them.

Its really good tea. Try it. 29,,2002 Jim Lai reports on Digifest 2002 in the new issue of Mindjack. I didnt have much in the way of expectations going in to Digifest 2002; pretty pictures, glitzy art/advertising pieces, and possibly some cool tech. I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations. Wednesday night. Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen. The theme of this international digital media festival was the \"4-D challenge\", to go beyond the third dimension. I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension. Now that Ive spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself. The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions. There was a soirée before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle. Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly. I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool. Business cards flowed like water. 27,,2002 I got an iBook! OSX sure takes some ajusting to but Im really impressed with it so far. 24,,2002 Neil Gaiman on whether someone should or should not be a writer: And in answer to your question, if you worry about job security as a writer, thats a very good indication that you arent a writer. Hating writing is another good one, although I know writers who hate writing. (They are miserable.) 18,,2002 In the new Mindjack: a report on SXSW Interactive by Jon Lebkowksy, with photos by Paul Bausch . This years South by Southwest Interactive conference was lean and mean - attended mainly by the core group of edgy net whackadistas, the conference had an interesting vibe, like \"Wow, glad the goddam dotcom splurge is over, lets get back to what we were doin…\" And what we were doin had real depth, it was way more compelling than ecommerce or net.publishing, the kinds of projects MBAs brought to the table when they started calling the Internet an industry and creating the concept of the IPO casino. 11,,2002 Mindjack is back from a short break with a great article by Douglas Rushkoff: Conforming to the Machine . 10,,2002 If you arent reading futurefeedforward , you should be. NEW YORK--ABC news magazine \"20/20\" reporter John Stossel, accidentally decapitated late last month while shooting a segment \"debunking the myth of wind power,\" returns to the air Wednesday in a special interview with 20/20 anchor Barbara Walters. \"Its really an amazing story,\" explains Walters. \"Most people wouldnt even survive decapitation, let alone have the guts, the determination, to keep doing their jobs. Its a real triumph of the human spirit.\" 05,,2002 Everyones favorite Cory Doctorow, Cory Doctorow, has gotten a new gig at the EFF, which reminds me that I havent suported them nearly enough. So, for the rest of Ive decided to donate $5 from each Mindjack t-shirt sold to EFF . 02,,2002 Daily Relay is finally back up. Were using Blogger as an interim solution and will probably switch to Blogger Pro if I cant get the Moveable Type problems sorted out. 29,,2002 This weeks Mindjack: Reading McLuhan by Melanie McBride. If theres a message of the for dummies age its that nothing is beyond our grasp. And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhans meaning has been reduced to a one-liner. This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhans literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught. 24,,2002 The new issue of Mindjack deals with one of my favorite topics: Robots! 15,,2002 My submission to the Burn Baby Burn mix CD swap, with dispraportionate amounts of Bowie and Reed, of course. (click to read tracklist) 14,,2002 Mindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff has started a blog . Expect good things. 13,,2002 Not that youd expect anything less, but the Criterion Collection website is really excellent. Its similar the old Criterion Goes To The Movies CD-ROM, which is also worth checking out. Although it takes some work to get it to run on any computer made in the last six or seven years. Both are filled with great essays on some of the best moves ever. 08,,2002 Weve got a great interview with Simon Singh , author of The Code Book , in the new issue of Mindjack. 28,,2002 Gadzooks, its been a long time since I last posted. Sorry. I interview Derek Powazek in the new Mindjack, in which he talks about online community, his book and weblogs as journalism. 21,,2002 Mindjack is trying out a new guerrila advertising campaign. Feel free to use either of this ads on your weblog or website. More to come soon. 17,,2002 Mindjack is back! Now to get back to work on this site. 28,,2002 Mindjack interviews Warren Ellis! So why arent you reading comics these days? Really, it doesnt seem to me that there are many comics being written for me. I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves. The Western medium has cycles, and its currently in a creative downturn. That doesnt mean there isnt excellent work being done. That simply means theres not much of it. And, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me. Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that I dont own a pair of Superman underpants. 26,,2002 Howard Rheingold interviewed on NPR (RealAudio link). I still havent gotten my copy of Smart Mobs yet, but hope to soon. 25,,2002 Mindjacks Jim Lai checks out an art exhibit in the form of a billboard: Transmedia 2002s 15 Seconds of Fame. 22,,2002 Now in Mindjack: Cybersecurity Nosebleed by Sarah Granger \"Security is the newest over-hyped commodity in the United States. I keep visualizing driving down highway 101 past billboards that read: \"Big government wants big security\" along with a picture of an ape beating on its chest. Somehow as seriously as they say they are, Im not convinced.\" 07,,2002 Mindjacks back , with a proper relaunch this time after a bit of a slow start last month. Weve got a lengthy article on Lawrence Lessig by Bryan Alexander this issue, plus my review of the neat little lespion digital camera. Spread the word! 05,,2002 Im kicking myself for missing the David Bowie concert on BBC Radio 2 today. But at least I was able to find a couple of the songs somewhere else . Bewlay Brothers is amazing. 01,,2002 In case anyones sitting on the edge of their site, rest assured the Mindjack relaunch is still on track for Monday. Get the word out. 01,,2002 I cant get enough of CBCs 50th anniversary specials. I wish theyd start a cable channel and show nothing but stuff from the 50s and 60s (and 70s and 80s too). 25,,2002 I just got Syberia and Post Mortem , two promising new adventure games from Montreal-based developer Microids . As you might be able to judge from some of my posts here, Im a big fan of adventure games. The traditional kind, where you can carry an enormous inventory in your pants, and explore the game at your own pace. Ive been thinking a lot about the genre lately and plan to write something about it soon, aside from reviews of the aforementioned games. Im interested in hearing your thoughts on adventure games. Do you think theres a place for them today? What are your favorite games? src=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/18/iaMjuWreTAS.js\"> Comments document.write(\"(\" + ct_18_iaMj + \")\"); 22,,2002 This doesnt bode well for me getting much work done this weekend. The Adrenaline Vaults Best Shareware of 2002 18,,2002 Justin Hall on South Korea: korea will be televised . TVs in cabs, TVs in subways, and stacks and stacks of tiny, tiny televisions to take with you. But I was still able to enjoy more television, this time in the Seoul subway. Televisions up in the subways, instead of static ad bulletin boards! This is the future! Its fun to see and fun to watch now. Soon it might be annoying or normal. But this first brush with more constant televisual stimulation was definitely exciting. 11,,2002 Id like to comment on Movielink , the new studio-approved online movie rental service, but unfortunately this is all Im able to see: 06,,2002 Sign #249 CNN needs some sense slapped into them: its the day after an election, Republicans have taken control the Senate, Dick Gephardt is stepping down as House minority leader and right now, on Larry King, theyre talking about the Winona Ryder verdict. At least they took down the BREAKING NEWS graphic. 04,,2002 Theres a new trailer for Steven Soderberghs Solaris up today -- one of the movies Im most looking forward this fall. I got a copy of the great DVD release of Tarkovskys original film from The Russian Cinema Council a short while ago. Which I hope to review for Mindjack before the new films released. 04,,2002 Cory Doctorow reviews Smart Mobs in the new Mindjack: Smart Mobs are the Slashdot effect applied to the meatspace zeitgeist. A squillion like-minded souls who dont know each other and will never meet pop out of the transmetropolitan brickface and break the white-noise balance of atomic viewpoints to speak with one voice, roaring a righteous YES or an adamant NO without organizers, without leaders, without manifestoes or forethought. Also this issue, an in-depth look at the Internet Archive by Doug Roberts. Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three. Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with 15-foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling. To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Bakers racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on its side to maximize the space. Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully. Walking into this echoey, over-warm warehouse space, its easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from 1996 until today. 21,,2002 Mindjack is back after a short break. The new issue has a report on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts. Supernova 2002 was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach, the organizer along with pulver.com, acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days. The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future. Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example. No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system. Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade. By then end of day one, however, it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging. 14,,2002 I just discovered through Smartmobs.com that Clive Thompson has a blog . Its great. Which reminds me, I really need to update the blogroll on this site. 09,,2002 Doug Roberts is covering Supernova for Mindjack and blogging it live . 08,,2002 Sometimes Amazon.com is just plain eerie. 29,,2003 If youre going to be in Los Angeles on 15, dont miss Live from the Blogosphere , a panel discussion to be put on by Rhizome.LA and moderated by Xeni Jardin. \"Live from the Blogosphere!\" brings together six innovators in blogging: Mark Frauenfelder, Heather Havrilesky, Evan Williams, Susannah Breslin, Doc Searls, and Tony Pierce. The panel will discuss the birth of blogging, the emergent tension between blogs and traditional journalism, innovations in blogging such as video-blogging, audio-blogging, and mobile-blogging, the shifting roles of race and gender in the Blogosphere, the state of the blog economy, and the way blogs may be reshaping contemporary media. (cross-posted from Daily Relay ) 20,,2003 I review a cool laptop bag today in Daily Relay . 19,,2003 Douglas Rushkoff meets Al Gore and is suitably impressed . He was a much brighter, open-minded, and - if I might add - cosmic thinker than I gave him credit for, before. I felt like he was really one of \"us,\" if you know what I mean: the kids in college who got those wild thoughts about how everything in the world, and even beyond, is connected somehow. And evolving. Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States, and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality. 24,,2003 New Mindjack up today! Cory Doctorow on William Gibson . Justin Hall on Super Monkey Ball 2 . 23,,2003 Check out this preview of Warren Ellis and Colleen Dorans new graphic novel, Orbiter . 19,,2003 Ah crap. Shift magazine publishes its last issue . Shift has pulled out from dire situations before, but this looks to be the end, which is a real shame. Theyve been a consistently great magazine and an important voice in the ever-changing sphere of digital culture. The final issue is due out in two weeks, I urge everyone to pick up a copy. 17,,2003 Mindjacks been slashdotted . 13,,2003 The Fray redesigned for the first time in over six years. Blog coming soon. 03,,2003 Deepsky have posted their remix of David Bowies \"I Took a Trip an a Gemini Spaceship\" on their website. Not as good as the original, but worth a listen. RealAudio link 16,,2003 This post by Warren Ellis to his blog isnt just cool because he linked to Mindjack: At Bruce Sterlings house in Austin, Texas, Howard Waldrop beams Cory Doctorow an mp3 of some swampy old rocknroll from the dawn of time. The next day, across town, his powerbook scorching the flesh off his legs, he beams it over to me in England. I put it up on a private server for Fraction in Kansas City and Laurenn in San Francisco, while reading the first few chapters of Corys new book, which he sent to me from an airport a few days before, squatting by the power outlet next to the public toilets. continued... 29,,2003 Slashdot launches games.slashdot.org and, holy cow, its ugly. 10,,2003 Mindjack contributor and game reviewer, Justin Hall, has written a great article on ethics in video game journalism for the Online Journalism Review. The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in 1981. Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: “To an extent, we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games, we wanted to see more of them, we wanted to keep writing about them.” Not much has changed in the past 20 years. Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics. 03,,2003 This is incredible. Scientists have discovered a \"Colossal\" squid in the Antartic, much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found. And its not even fully grown. Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration. Just imagine that theres something like this that no one has ever seen alive. Its interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel. While its great theres some funding available, just as with space exploration, there should be much more. 27,,2003 Googling for sites that mention Mindjack, other than mindjack.com, suprisingly results in 5,800 links. I like the description on this one . Mindjack Magazine. One pusle showing the osmotic swelling of Digital culture as the norm. 26,,2003 New Mindjack up today. Josh examines the online, interconnected groups of people that you turn to for advice on music, art, fashion, books, etc., and the broader implications of these taste tribes. Also, Justin Hall reviews Panzer Dragoon Orta for Xbox. The illustration, btw, is by Matt Hinrichs , who will hopefully be doing semi-regular ones for us. 24,,2003 I review Soul Calibur 2, Syberia, and Post Mortem in the new Mindjack. 19,,2003 Via scrubbles.net : a (nearly) complete index of Alfred Hitchcocks cameos . 12,,2003 My article, Reunderstanding Movies , about how DVDs and the Internet are changing the way we watch movies, is in the new Mindjack . 02,,2003 Ive started a film blog: melanson.ca/movies .

Weve got lots of good stuff coming up in Mindjack in the next few months, so keep your eye on the blog for further updates. 21,,2004 Apparently from a sidewalk in Austin. 19,,2004 Derek Powazeks comment over in this entry at Blackbeltjones reminded me of Amazon.coms incredibly good Friends & Favorites area. Mr. Bezos, if youre reading this, please add this to Amazon.ca . Canadians have friends too. 18,,2004 Ive been playing around with Flickr lately, the latest toy from the mad geniuses at Ludicorp . You can find my Flickr profile here . Ive also started a Mindjack group as a bit of an experiment.

This is a contract job that can be done from home. If youre interested, please email: donald@mindjack.com (no attachments). Also, were constantly looking for great new writers. If you want to write for us, drop an email. 17,,2004 Im pleased to announce that VRML creator and all-around visionary Mark Pesce has joined Mindjacks ever-growing stable of writers. His first article, Redefining Television , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium. Heres a snippet: In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in 1984 and Ray Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451 projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they werent that far off the mark. But heres the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. Actually, theyve already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this. To understand why, we need to go back to first principles. What is television? Heres a functional definition: Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images. This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era. Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies. 10,,2004 Im using this blog to play around with Bloggers new features .

Check your local listings for the time. 26,,2001 ATMs dispensing music? I do not quite see the logic in that. I am not entirely against paying a nominal fee for music, or any other media, but if I do have to pay for it Id be much more likely to buy stuff from my own PC. 22,,2001 My chair started squeaking a few days ago and its driving me nuts! 20,,2001 The New York Press has a lenghty article about the post dotcom crash scene that is worth reading. 18,,2001 Francis Collins 10 Most Surprising Things About the Human Genome . 18,,2001 FILMSPEED has great movies you can download for free.

Heres hoping I will be a bit more successful with this. Big thanks to Bopjet for hosting this and Mindjack . 31,,2001 The Register reports on \"war driving\" - the wireless equivalent of war dialing. Instead of having your modem dial into thousands of networks until you get in, you just drive within range of a wireless net with your wireless-equipped laptop and hack away. related: The latest issue of CIO has a great feature on wireless. 30,,2001 Short documentary on digital filmmaking and Star Wars Episode II. 27,,2001 Rumour has it that the parent companies of Inside.com and Brills Content will be announcing a merger as early as next Monday.

My moneys on Mothra. 26,,2001 I just spent some time playing with the beta version of Atmosphere , Adobes new 3D environment software, and thought Id give a couple of quick impressions. I have always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community. You could build all these really cool places but people could not interact in them. You also could not easily move from one 3D environment to another without going back and forth between 2D web pages. I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista?) but it did not as far as we would have liked. Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems. Its not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance. 25,,2001 Thanks to Onebox.com I should now be able to receive faxes.

Today the stock tumbled . 07,,2001 The Times reports that the Trogan Room Coffee Machine webcam is going offline for good later this year.

I have got a nagging feeling that I am going to have to do a complete format and reinstall Windows but I really do not want to do that. 03,,2001 Mikel.org pointed me to this rumor that Automatic Media is in trouble . Automatic is the company that consists of Feed, Suck and Plastic. Hopefully it is just a rumour. 03,,2001 Home of the Underdogs is an amazing resource for anyone that loves computer games. Not only do they have hundreds of games you can download which are no longer available from the companies, they also have a wealth of information about many of the games.

But its damn good advertising. 11,,2001 DSL! 09,,2001 Feed has a great interview with Cory Doctorow today. The overlap between Doctorows day job at OpenCola and his night job writing fiction makes for a unique combination: Its almost like William Gibson launching a company that sells neural plugs and stim-sims. 01,,2001 Douglas Rushkoffs Frontline documentary, The Merchants of Cool is being rebroadcast tonight on PBS (check your local listings). Set your Tivo or VCR, or watch it as its on even. 01,,2001 I am DSLless for 10 days.

The same goes for Suck , although it looks like Plastic will be continuing for now. Both FEED and Suck have been online for six years, and have been excellent throughout. Hopefully they can pull out this funk and come back in one form or another in a few months. 05,,2001 Jason Kottke has some great pictures from the Louvre today. 02,,2001 Great roadtrip article by Mark Frauenfelder in One magazine. \"A half-century ago, the streets of Southern California were filled with flamboyant towers of consumerism -- spires and obelisks and beacons -- transmitting neon-fortified messages of optimism to families riding in cars with space-age tailfins. Life was good, and the marvels of modern science were making a world as new as tomorrow.\" 30,,2001 Bill Frisells latest album Blues Dream arrived in the mail today and it only confirmed what I suspected.

The whole thing consists of William Gibson sitting in the back of a limo musing on everything from cyberspace to religion. I will be doing a full review in Mindjack within the next couple of weeks. 02,,2001 Heres what the Slashdot effect looks like. 31,,2001 New Mindjack today. Twenty Twenty : Astronomical Vision by Chris McKinstry \"Very early on a cold morning in 1979 I looked with one of my highly astigmatic eyes through my first professional telescope at a setting Jupiter. Even with my flawed vision, the long white metal tube so finely manufactured it could have been a piece of sophisticated medical equipment, let the cloud bands of our solar system’s largest planet and the bright points of a handful of its moons into my mind, making me feel a shadow of the shock that Galileo must have felt when he saw the same sight before any of us. \" 20,,2001 I redesigned Mindjack a bit. It should load quite a bit faster now, and look better at lower resolutions. New this week, Design for Community reviewed by David Brake. Next week, an interview with Derek Powazek. 17,,2001 The new Infinite Matrix is up with a long excerpt of Cory Doctorows new novel, Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom . The Liberty Square ad-hocs were the staunchest conservatives in the Magic Kingdom, preserving the wheezing technology in the face of a Park that changed almost daily. The newcomer/old-timers were on-side with the rest of the Park, had their support, and looked like they might make a successful go of it. 02,,2001 I am the top left corner on Cory Doctorows Four blogs on one page , which is one excuse why I have not been posting to this blog very much lately. I will try to give myself a kick in the pants over the x-mas break and get this thing going again. 27,,2002 Wonderful gallery of Atari concept illustrations. via BoingBoing 21,,2002 I redesigned the Mindjack front page a bit to include the entire Daily Relay blog , rather than just excerpts. 20,,2002 denizen is a new weblog about classic gaming from the creator of Home of the Underdogs . 20,,2002 Now in Mindjack, a review of the Xircom Wireless LAN Module for Palm m500 handhelds. A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting. Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience. One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. Working on an airplane or from a café just felt wrong. This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If you have used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I am talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you will not go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I have stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I cannot choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, 802.11 ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all. And it keeps on getting better. 802.11 is not just a technology, its a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your 802.11-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If you are in a major city, chances are you will find one before you go a block. Forget 3G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control. 16,,2002 Mindjack T-shirts are now available . These are high-quality, genuine screenprinted shirts, not the Cafe Press stuff. Thanks Brunetto ! If you are looking to get some shirts printed I highly recommend them. Also available are Mindjack coffee mugs , featuring an illustration by Matt Hinrichs . These are Cafe Press ones. Please buy some. 14,,2002 Build your own robot! CAM-08 – The Perpetual Humanoid Model . I want one. Especially if it comes with the sound effects in this video . 28,,2002 needs at least five more days. I still have loads of work that was supposed to be done by now. 26,,2002 Well, this blog is back and oranger than ever. Now just to get Daily Relay back up and running. 12,,2002 My mindjack.com email should be working now. Let me know if you still have problems. 11,,2002 Crap. All my @mindjack.com email addresses are messed up. If you need to reach me please use donald@melanson.ca. 03,,2002 Whod have thought Mattel is still making classic electronic football games . I used to think these were the most amazing things ever. Then I got an Atari 2600. 03,,2002 there is a great little Chinese grocery down the street from my apartment where I always find something I have never tried before. Today: Iron Buddha Tea. Its really good tea. Try it. 29,,2002 Jim Lai reports on Digifest 2002 in the new issue of Mindjack. I did not have much in the way of expectations going in to Digifest 2002; pretty pictures, glitzy art/advertising pieces, and possibly some cool tech. I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations. Wednesday night. Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen. The theme of this international digital media festival was the \"4-D challenge\", to go beyond the third dimension. I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension. Now that I have spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself. The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions. There was a soirée before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle. Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly. I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool. Business cards flowed like water. 27,,2002 I got an iBook! OSX sure takes some ajusting to but I am really impressed with it so far. 24,,2002 Neil Gaiman on whether someone should or should not be a writer: And in answer to your question, if you worry about job security as a writer, that is a very good indication that you are not a writer. Hating writing is another good one, although I know writers who hate writing. (They are miserable.) 18,,2002 In the new Mindjack: a report on SXSW Interactive by Jon Lebkowksy, with photos by Paul Bausch . This years South by Southwest Interactive conference was lean and mean - attended mainly by the core group of edgy net whackadistas, the conference had an interesting vibe, like \"Wow, glad the goddam dotcom splurge is over, let us get back to what we were doing…\" And what we were doing had real depth, it was way more compelling than ecommerce or net.publishing, the kinds of projects MBAs brought to the table when they started calling the Internet an industry and creating the concept of the IPO casino. 11,,2002 Mindjack is back from a short break with a great article by Douglas Rushkoff: Conforming to the Machine . 10,,2002 If you are not reading futurefeedforward , you should be. NEW YORK--ABC news magazine \"20/20\" reporter John Stossel, accidentally decapitated late last month while shooting a segment \"debunking the myth of wind power,\" returns to the air Wednesday in a special interview with 20/20 anchor Barbara Walters. \"Its really an amazing story,\" explains Walters. \"Most people would not even survive decapitation, let alone have the guts, the determination, to keep doing their jobs. Its a real triumph of the human spirit.\" 05,,2002 Everyones favorite Cory Doctorow, Cory Doctorow, has gotten a new gig at the EFF, which reminds me that I have not suported them nearly enough. So, for the rest of I have decided to donate $5 from each Mindjack t-shirt sold to EFF . 02,,2002 Daily Relay is finally back up. Were using Blogger as an interim solution and will probably switch to Blogger Pro if I cannot get the Moveable Type problems sorted out. 29,,2002 This weeks Mindjack: Reading McLuhan by Melanie McBride. If there is a message of the for dummies age its that nothing is beyond our grasp. And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhans meaning has been reduced to a one-liner. This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhans literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught. 24,,2002 The new issue of Mindjack deals with one of my favorite topics: Robots! 15,,2002 My submission to the Burn Baby Burn mix CD swap, with dispraportionate amounts of Bowie and Reed, of course. (click to read tracklist) 14,,2002 Mindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff has started a blog . Expect good things. 13,,2002 Not that you would expect anything less, but the Criterion Collection website is really excellent. Its similar the old Criterion Goes To The Movies CD-ROM, which is also worth checking out. Although it takes some work to get it to run on any computer made in the last six or seven years. Both are filled with great essays on some of the best moves ever. 08,,2002 we have got a great interview with Simon Singh , author of The Code Book , in the new issue of Mindjack. 28,,2002 Gadzooks, its been a long time since I last posted. Sorry. I interview Derek Powazek in the new Mindjack, in which he talks about online community, his book and weblogs as journalism. 21,,2002 Mindjack is trying out a new guerrila advertising campaign. Feel free to use either of this ads on your weblog or website. More to come soon. 17,,2002 Mindjack is back! Now to get back to work on this site. 28,,2002 Mindjack interviews Warren Ellis! So why are not you reading comics these days? Really, it does not seem to me that there are many comics being written for me. I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves. The Western medium has cycles, and its currently in a creative downturn. That does not mean there is not excellent work being done. That simply means there is not much of it. And, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me. Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that I do not own a pair of Superman underpants. 26,,2002 Howard Rheingold interviewed on NPR (RealAudio link). I still have not gotten my copy of Smart Mobs yet, but hope to soon. 25,,2002 Mindjacks Jim Lai checks out an art exhibit in the form of a billboard: Transmedia 2002s 15 Seconds of Fame. 22,,2002 Now in Mindjack: Cybersecurity Nosebleed by Sarah Granger \"Security is the newest over-hyped commodity in the United States. I keep visualizing driving down highway 101 past billboards that read: \"Big government wants big security\" along with a picture of an ape beating on its chest. Somehow as seriously as they say they are, I am not convinced.\" 07,,2002 Mindjacks back , with a proper relaunch this time after a bit of a slow start last month. we have got a lengthy article on Lawrence Lessig by Bryan Alexander this issue, plus my review of the neat little lespion digital camera. Spread the word! 05,,2002 I am kicking myself for missing the David Bowie concert on BBC Radio 2 today. But at least I was able to find a couple of the songs somewhere else . Bewlay Brothers is amazing. 01,,2002 In case anyones sitting on the edge of their site, rest assured the Mindjack relaunch is still on track for Monday. Get the word out. 01,,2002 I cannot get enough of CBCs 50th anniversary specials. I wish they would start a cable channel and show nothing but stuff from the 50s and 60s (and 70s and 80s too). 25,,2002 I just got Syberia and Post Mortem , two promising new adventure games from Montreal-based developer Microids . As you might be able to judge from some of my posts here, I am a big fan of adventure games. The traditional kind, where you can carry an enormous inventory in your pants, and explore the game at your own pace. I have been thinking a lot about the genre lately and plan to write something about it soon, aside from reviews of the aforementioned games. I am interested in hearing your thoughts on adventure games. Do you think there is a place for them today? What are your favorite games? src=\"http://www.quicktopic.com/18/iaMjuWreTAS.js\"> Comments document.write(\"(\" + ct_18_iaMj + \")\"); 22,,2002 This does not bode well for me getting much work done this weekend. The Adrenaline Vaults Best Shareware of 2002 18,,2002 Justin Hall on South Korea: korea will be televised . TVs in cabs, TVs in subways, and stacks and stacks of tiny, tiny televisions to take with you. But I was still able to enjoy more television, this time in the Seoul subway. Televisions up in the subways, instead of static ad bulletin boards! This is the future! Its fun to see and fun to watch now. Soon it might be annoying or normal. But this first brush with more constant televisual stimulation was definitely exciting. 11,,2002 Id like to comment on Movielink , the new studio-approved online movie rental service, but unfortunately this is all I am able to see: 06,,2002 Sign #249 CNN needs some sense slapped into them: its the day after an election, Republicans have taken control the Senate, Dick Gephardt is stepping down as House minority leader and right now, on Larry King, they are talking about the Winona Ryder verdict. At least they took down the BREAKING NEWS graphic. 04,,2002 there is a new trailer for Steven Soderberghs Solaris up today -- one of the movies I am most looking forward this fall. I got a copy of the great DVD release of Tarkovskys original film from The Russian Cinema Council a short while ago. Which I hope to review for Mindjack before the new films released. 04,,2002 Cory Doctorow reviews Smart Mobs in the new Mindjack: Smart Mobs are the Slashdot effect applied to the meatspace zeitgeist. A squillion like-minded souls who do not know each other and will never meet pop out of the transmetropolitan brickface and break the white-noise balance of atomic viewpoints to speak with one voice, roaring a righteous YES or an adamant NO without organizers, without leaders, without manifestoes or forethought. Also this issue, an in-depth look at the Internet Archive by Doug Roberts. Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three. Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with 15-foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling. To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Bakers racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on its side to maximize the space. Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully. Walking into this echoey, over-warm warehouse space, its easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from 1996 until today. 21,,2002 Mindjack is back after a short break. The new issue has a report on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts. Supernova 2002 was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach, the organizer along with pulver.com, acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days. The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future. Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example. No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system. Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade. By then end of day one, however, it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging. 14,,2002 I just discovered through Smartmobs.com that Clive Thompson has a blog . Its great. Which reminds me, I really need to update the blogroll on this site. 09,,2002 Doug Roberts is covering Supernova for Mindjack and blogging it live . 08,,2002 Sometimes Amazon.com is just plain eerie. 29,,2003 If you are going to be in Los Angeles on 15, do not miss Live from the Blogosphere , a panel discussion to be put on by Rhizome.LA and moderated by Xeni Jardin. \"Live from the Blogosphere!\" brings together six innovators in blogging: Mark Frauenfelder, Heather Havrilesky, Evan Williams, Susannah Breslin, Doc Searls, and Tony Pierce. The panel will discuss the birth of blogging, the emergent tension between blogs and traditional journalism, innovations in blogging such as video-blogging, audio-blogging, and mobile-blogging, the shifting roles of race and gender in the Blogosphere, the state of the blog economy, and the way blogs may be reshaping contemporary media. (cross-posted from Daily Relay ) 20,,2003 I review a cool laptop bag today in Daily Relay . 19,,2003 Douglas Rushkoff meets Al Gore and is suitably impressed . He was a much brighter, open-minded, and - if I might add - cosmic thinker than I gave him credit for, before. I felt like he was really one of \"us,\" if you know what I mean: the kids in college who got those wild thoughts about how everything in the world, and even beyond, is connected somehow. And evolving. Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States, and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality. 24,,2003 New Mindjack up today! Cory Doctorow on William Gibson . Justin Hall on Super Monkey Ball 2 . 23,,2003 Check out this preview of Warren Ellis and Colleen Dorans new graphic novel, Orbiter . 19,,2003 Ah crap. Shift magazine publishes its last issue . Shift has pulled out from dire situations before, but this looks to be the end, which is a real shame. they have been a consistently great magazine and an important voice in the ever-changing sphere of digital culture. The final issue is due out in two weeks, I urge everyone to pick up a copy. 17,,2003 Mindjacks been slashdotted . 13,,2003 The Fray redesigned for the first time in over six years. Blog coming soon. 03,,2003 Deepsky have posted their remix of David Bowies \"I Took a Trip an a Gemini Spaceship\" on their website. Not as good as the original, but worth a listen. RealAudio link 16,,2003 This post by Warren Ellis to his blog is not just cool because he linked to Mindjack: At Bruce Sterlings house in Austin, Texas, Howard Waldrop beams Cory Doctorow an mp3 of some swampy old rocknroll from the dawn of time. The next day, across town, his powerbook scorching the flesh off his legs, he beams it over to me in England. I put it up on a private server for Fraction in Kansas City and Laurenn in San Francisco, while reading the first few chapters of Corys new book, which he sent to me from an airport a few days before, squatting by the power outlet next to the public toilets. continued... 29,,2003 Slashdot launches games.slashdot.org and, holy cow, its ugly. 10,,2003 Mindjack contributor and game reviewer, Justin Hall, has written a great article on ethics in video game journalism for the Online Journalism Review. The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in 1981. Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: “To an extent, we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games, we wanted to see more of them, we wanted to keep writing about them.” Not much has changed in the past 20 years. Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics. 03,,2003 This is incredible. Scientists have discovered a \"Colossal\" squid in the Antartic, much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found. And its not even fully grown. Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration. Just imagine that there is something like this that no one has ever seen alive. Its interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel. While its great there is some funding available, just as with space exploration, there should be much more. 27,,2003 Googling for sites that mention Mindjack, other than mindjack.com, suprisingly results in 5,800 links. I like the description on this one . Mindjack Magazine. One pusle showing the osmotic swelling of Digital culture as the norm. 26,,2003 New Mindjack up today. Josh examines the online, interconnected groups of people that you turn to for advice on music, art, fashion, books, etc., and the broader implications of these taste tribes. Also, Justin Hall reviews Panzer Dragoon Orta for Xbox. The illustration, btw, is by Matt Hinrichs , who will hopefully be doing semi-regular ones for us. 24,,2003 I review Soul Calibur 2, Syberia, and Post Mortem in the new Mindjack. 19,,2003 Via scrubbles.net : a (nearly) complete index of Alfred Hitchcocks cameos . 12,,2003 My article, Reunderstanding Movies , about how DVDs and the Internet are changing the way we watch movies, is in the new Mindjack . 02,,2003 I have started a film blog: melanson.ca/movies . No promises on how often I will post to it, but I try to do as many reviews as I can. 31,,2004 For your linking pleasure, a new Mindjack ad. More sizes coming soon. 21,,2004 I have been blogging more at Mindjacks Daily Relay lately and hope to be able to keep it up. we have got lots of good stuff coming up in Mindjack in the next few months, so keep your eye on the blog for further updates. 21,,2004 Apparently from a sidewalk in Austin. 19,,2004 Derek Powazeks comment over in this entry at Blackbeltjones reminded me of Amazon.coms incredibly good Friends & Favorites area. Mr. Bezos, if you are reading this, please add this to Amazon.ca . Canadians have friends too. 18,,2004 I have been playing around with Flickr lately, the latest toy from the mad geniuses at Ludicorp . You can find my Flickr profile here . I have also started a Mindjack group as a bit of an experiment. If it works out I may try to integrate it into the site. 12,,2004 Now in Mindjack: Is Nothing Sacred? Digital Music for a Digital Age by Ian Dawe. Antero Allis Hysteria reviewed on DVD by Jesse Walker. 24,,2004 1250_img0028 Originally uploaded by QuizMaster2000 . Posted by Don Melanson from Flickr . 19,,2004 The new issue of Mindjack is now online . In this issue: Linked Out: blogging, equality and the future by Melanie McBride. Plus Kill Bill Vol. 2 reviewed by Jesse Walker. 12,,2004 there is a new issue of Mindjack now online. In it, the first article from Mindjacks newest contributor J.D. Lasica; he writes about copyright law in \"The Killing Fields\" . Also, I review DVDs of Breathless, Russian Ark, and Z . Spread the word. 07,,2004 \"An idea is a funny thing. It does nothing unless you do.\" 06,,2004 I am looking for someone to be Advertising Director for Mindjack. Must have advertising sales experience and be willing to work on commission. This is a contract job that can be done from home. If you are interested, please email: donald@mindjack.com (no attachments). Also, were constantly looking for great new writers. If you want to write for us, drop an email. 17,,2004 I am pleased to announce that VRML creator and all-around visionary Mark Pesce has joined Mindjacks ever-growing stable of writers. His first article, Redefining Television , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium. Heres a snippet: In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in 1984 and Ray Bradbury in Fahrenheit 451 projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they were not that far off the mark. But heres the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. Actually, they have already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this. To understand why, we need to go back to first principles. What is television? Heres a functional definition: Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images. This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era. Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies. 10,,2004 I am using this blog to play around with Bloggers new features . It will return to normal shortly. 28,,2004 I am blogging a lot more on my film blog than I am here. If you like movies, check it out. And, of course, I continue to write and blog at Mindjack .'"

The Merchants of Cool , a Frontline documentary featuring Mindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff, is on PBS tonight. Check your local listings for the time.  ATMs dispensing music? I do not quite see the logic in that. I am not entirely against paying a nominal fee for music, or any other media, but if I do have to pay for it Id be much more likely to buy stuff from my own PC.

Destroy All Monsters - Survivor: Monster Island . My moneys on Mothra.  I just spent some time playing with the beta version of Atmosphere , Adobes new D environment software, and thought Id give a couple of quick impressions. I have always been interested in VR and spent quite a bit of time working in VRML, but I think the inherant problem with VRML was that not enough attention had been given to community. You could build all these really cool places but people could not interact in them. You also could not easily move from one D environment to another without going back and forth between D web pages. I was involved with a project that tried to solve some of these problems with VRML (anybody remember Terra Vista?) but it did not as far as we would have liked. Atmosphere appears to have addressed these problems. Its not the first product to do so, but maybe Adobe has enough muscle for it to gain wide acceptance.  Thanks to Onebox.com I should now be able to receive faxes. Not suprisingly, they do not have local phone numbers for Fredericton so I chose a New York City area code.

From Mike Sugarbakers review of Lemon : \"If you have no patience for the lengthy ruminations of brilliant madmen, Lemon is not for you. But you read Mindjack, so you are probably into that sort of thing, right?\"  Mindjack is featured in the links section of this months Netlife magazine . It does not seem to be online yet so heres a scan:  Well, the big Yahoo news yesterday was that Tim Koogle is stepping down as CEO and that they will miss forecasts in the first quarter. Today the stock tumbled .  The Times reports that the Trogan Room Coffee Machine webcam is going offline for good later this year. That pot should go in a museum.  It looks like there is some big news due from Yahoo later today.  The new issue of Mindjack Magazine is now online, featuring a first for us - a live concert review. With original photos even.

Mikel.org pointed me to this rumor that Automatic Media is in trouble . Automatic is the company that consists of Feed, Suck and Plastic. Hopefully it is just a rumour.  Home of the Underdogs is an amazing resource for anyone that loves computer games. Not only do they have hundreds of games you can download which are no longer available from the companies, they also have a wealth of information about many of the games. Its not entirely legal, but I think its a great public service. Its even better now that they have one of my favorite games, Gabriel Knight .  there is a great article by William Gibson in the The Observers Special Japan Issue .

CNET has video of Steve Jobs tour of Apples new retail stores.  are not It Cool News has some great clips and pictures from the new Coen Brothers film, The Man Who Was Not There. I am excited.  Yet another redesign. I think I will stick with this one for a while.  Sure, its advertising. But its damn good advertising.  DSL!  Feed has a great interview with Cory Doctorow today. The overlap between Doctorows day job at OpenCola and his night job writing fiction makes for a unique combination: Its almost like William Gibson launching a company that sells neural plugs and stim-sims.  Douglas Rushkoffs Frontline documentary, The Merchants of Cool is being rebroadcast tonight on PBS (check your local listings). Set your Tivo or VCR, or watch it as its on even.  I am DSLless for  days. I suppose compared to most other companies that is pretty snappy service, but its still  days without DSL.  FEED gave the official word today that they are sutting down, at least for the foreseeable future. The same goes for Suck , although it looks like Plastic will be continuing for now. Both FEED and Suck have been online for six years, and have been excellent throughout. Hopefully they can pull out this funk and come back in one form or another in a few months.  Jason Kottke has some great pictures from the Louvre today.  Great roadtrip article by Mark Frauenfelder in One magazine. \"A half-century ago, the streets of Southern California were filled with flamboyant towers of consumerism -- spires and obelisks and beacons -- transmitting neon-fortified messages of optimism to families riding in cars with space-age tailfins.

They do not make keyboards like this anymore. This is the Underwood Portable I mentioned the other day.  StarOffice  looks like it will be a big improvement over the current version. I have been using StarOffice as an alternative to PowerPoint, but the sluggishness mentioned in this article has stopped me from using it regularly for much else.  Synapse is now offiicially open.

The whole thing consists of William Gibson sitting in the back of a limo musing on everything from cyberspace to religion. I will be doing a full review in Mindjack within the next couple of weeks.  Heres what the Slashdot effect looks like.  New Mindjack today. Twenty Twenty : Astronomical Vision by Chris McKinstry \"Very early on a cold morning in  I looked with one of my highly astigmatic eyes through my first professional telescope at a setting Jupiter. Even with my flawed vision, the long white metal tube so finely manufactured it could have been a piece of sophisticated medical equipment, let the cloud bands of our solar system’s largest planet and the bright points of a handful of its moons into my mind, making me feel a shadow of the shock that Galileo must have felt when he saw the same sight before any of us. \"  I redesigned Mindjack a bit. It should load quite a bit faster now, and look better at lower resolutions. New this week, Design for Community reviewed by David Brake. Next week, an interview with Derek Powazek.  The new Infinite Matrix is up with a long excerpt of Cory Doctorows new novel, Down And Out In The Magic Kingdom . The Liberty Square ad-hocs were the staunchest conservatives in the Magic Kingdom, preserving the wheezing technology in the face of a Park that changed almost daily. The newcomer/old-timers were on-side with the rest of the Park, had their support, and looked like they might make a successful go of it.  I am the top left corner on Cory Doctorows Four blogs on one page , which is one excuse why I have not been posting to this blog very much lately. I will try to give myself a kick in the pants over the x-mas break and get this thing going again.  Wonderful gallery of Atari concept illustrations. via BoingBoing  I redesigned the Mindjack front page a bit to include the entire Daily Relay blog , rather than just excerpts.  denizen is a new weblog about classic gaming from the creator of Home of the Underdogs .  Now in Mindjack, a review of the Xircom Wireless LAN Module for Palm m handhelds. A subject that only Cory Doctorow could make this interesting. Four or five years ago, I had a sea-change in my computing experience. One day, I realized that I had started to view any computer not connected to the Internet as just a fancy game-console-cum-jumped-up-typewriter. Working on an airplane or from a café just felt wrong. This feeling deepened and magnified a thousandfold the day I got my first iBook and Airport Base Station. If you have used wireless networking on a laptop, you know what I am talking about -- snatching the Internet out of the very air is an experience you will not go back from willingly (another one is TiVo -- I have stopped watching TV in hotel rooms because I cannot choose among thirty hours of custom-recorded programming and skip commercials). Just as TiVo ruined me for dumb TV, . ruined me for wired networking or no networking at all. And it keeps on getting better. . is not just a technology, its a movement, an ad-hoc world of open base-stations around the world. Just haul out your .-equipped device and start hunting about for a network. If you are in a major city, chances are you will find one before you go a block. Forget G and Blackberry and all those other pale imitations of connectivity: community wireless is the real shit: fast, unmetered, insecure and out of control.  Mindjack T-shirts are now available .

Try it.  Jim Lai reports on Digifest  in the new issue of Mindjack. I did not have much in the way of expectations going in to Digifest ; pretty pictures, glitzy art/advertising pieces, and possibly some cool tech. I was pleasantly surprised by the breadth and depth of the presentations. Wednesday night. Hit the media session and got to see some graphics on a really big screen. The theme of this international digital media festival was the \"-D challenge\", to go beyond the third dimension. I would deem this festival to be a success overall, as by the end of the festival it would be apparent that there was much speculation on what constitutes this fourth dimension. Now that I have spoiled the ending and gotten that out of the way, on with the festival itself. The original vision was for local (Toronto) participation, but it quickly expanded in scope with the arrival of international submissions. There was a soirée before the keynote where attendees could snack on catered food and mingle. Quite a few people were there, many of them either dressed hip or stylishly. I almost felt that I was underdressed, but I just put on my best casual face and it was all cool. Business cards flowed like water.  I got an iBook! OSX sure takes some ajusting to but I am really impressed with it so far.  Neil Gaiman on whether someone should or should not be a writer: And in answer to your question, if you worry about job security as a writer, that is a very good indication that you are not a writer. Hating writing is another good one, although I know writers who hate writing. (They are miserable.)  In the new Mindjack: a report on SXSW Interactive by Jon Lebkowksy, with photos by Paul Bausch . This years South by Southwest Interactive conference was lean and mean - attended mainly by the core group of edgy net whackadistas, the conference had an interesting vibe, like \"Wow, glad the goddam dotcom splurge is over, let us get back to what we were doing…\" And what we were doing had real depth, it was way more compelling than ecommerce or net.publishing, the kinds of projects MBAs brought to the table when they started calling the Internet an industry and creating the concept of the IPO casino.  Mindjack is back from a short break with a great article by Douglas Rushkoff: Conforming to the Machine .  If you are not reading futurefeedforward , you should be. NEW YORK--ABC news magazine \"/\" reporter John Stossel, accidentally decapitated late last month while shooting a segment \"debunking the myth of wind power,\" returns to the air Wednesday in a special interview with / anchor Barbara Walters. \"Its really an amazing story,\" explains Walters. \"Most people would not even survive decapitation, let alone have the guts, the determination, to keep doing their jobs. Its a real triumph of the human spirit.\"  Everyones favorite Cory Doctorow, Cory Doctorow, has gotten a new gig at the EFF, which reminds me that I have not suported them nearly enough. So, for the rest of I have decided to donate $ from each Mindjack t-shirt sold to EFF .  Daily Relay is finally back up. Were using Blogger as an interim solution and will probably switch to Blogger Pro if I cannot get the Moveable Type problems sorted out.  This weeks Mindjack: Reading McLuhan by Melanie McBride. If there is a message of the for dummies age its that nothing is beyond our grasp. And our desire to believe this is reinforced by trends like usability, which privilege economy over elucidation. No one anticipated it all better than Marshall McLuhan, who whittled big insights into sound bites in order to engage an audience beyond the lecture halls of the University of Toronto. With the help of Tom Wolfe and others, the scholarly McLuhan became a cool media prophet. It was, and still is, a practical strategy in anti-intellectual times. But in the process, much of McLuhans meaning has been reduced to a one-liner. This has as much to do with the absence of commentary on McLuhans literary, philosophical and cultural influences as it does with the way his work is taught.  The new issue of Mindjack deals with one of my favorite topics: Robots!  My submission to the Burn Baby Burn mix CD swap, with dispraportionate amounts of Bowie and Reed, of course. (click to read tracklist)  Mindjack advisory board member Douglas Rushkoff has started a blog . Expect good things.  Not that you would expect anything less, but the Criterion Collection website is really excellent. Its similar the old Criterion Goes To The Movies CD-ROM, which is also worth checking out. Although it takes some work to get it to run on any computer made in the last six or seven years. Both are filled with great essays on some of the best moves ever.  we have got a great interview with Simon Singh , author of The Code Book , in the new issue of Mindjack.  Gadzooks, its been a long time since I last posted. Sorry. I interview Derek Powazek in the new Mindjack, in which he talks about online community, his book and weblogs as journalism.  Mindjack is trying out a new guerrila advertising campaign. Feel free to use either of this ads on your weblog or website. More to come soon.  Mindjack is back! Now to get back to work on this site.  Mindjack interviews Warren Ellis! So why are not you reading comics these days? Really, it does not seem to me that there are many comics being written for me. I want something with a little more muscle and bite than standard-issue power fantasies, whimsical romance, the autobiographies of people who never do anything and things with elves. The Western medium has cycles, and its currently in a creative downturn. That does not mean there is not excellent work being done. That simply means there is not much of it. And, on a personal level, little of it is talking to me. Not many comics reflect the fact that I live in a multicultural society fitted with a global communications net, nor do they reflect the fact that I do not own a pair of Superman underpants.  Howard Rheingold interviewed on NPR (RealAudio link). I still have not gotten my copy of Smart Mobs yet, but hope to soon.  Mindjacks Jim Lai checks out an art exhibit in the form of a billboard: Transmedia s  Seconds of Fame.  Now in Mindjack: Cybersecurity Nosebleed by Sarah Granger \"Security is the newest over-hyped commodity in the United States. I keep visualizing driving down highway  past billboards that read: \"Big government wants big security\" along with a picture of an ape beating on its chest. Somehow as seriously as they say they are, I am not convinced.\"  Mindjacks back , with a proper relaunch this time after a bit of a slow start last month. we have got a lengthy article on Lawrence Lessig by Bryan Alexander this issue, plus my review of the neat little lespion digital camera. Spread the word!  I am kicking myself for missing the David Bowie concert on BBC Radio  today. But at least I was able to find a couple of the songs somewhere else . Bewlay Brothers is amazing.  In case anyones sitting on the edge of their site, rest assured the Mindjack relaunch is still on track for Monday. Get the word out.  I cannot get enough of CBCs th anniversary specials. I wish they would start a cable channel and show nothing but stuff from the s and s (and s and s too).  I just got Syberia and Post Mortem , two promising new adventure games from Montreal-based developer Microids . As you might be able to judge from some of my posts here, I am a big fan of adventure games. The traditional kind, where you can carry an enormous inventory in your pants, and explore the game at your own pace. I have been thinking a lot about the genre lately and plan to write something about it soon, aside from reviews of the aforementioned games. I am interested in hearing your thoughts on adventure games. Do you think there is a place for them today? What are your favorite games? src=\"http://www.quicktopic.com//iaMjuWreTAS.js\"> Comments document.write(\"(\" + ct__iaMj + \")\");  This does not bode well for me getting much work done this weekend. The Adrenaline Vaults Best Shareware of   Justin Hall on South Korea: korea will be televised . TVs in cabs, TVs in subways, and stacks and stacks of tiny, tiny televisions to take with you. But I was still able to enjoy more television, this time in the Seoul subway. Televisions up in the subways, instead of static ad bulletin boards! This is the future! Its fun to see and fun to watch now. Soon it might be annoying or normal. But this first brush with more constant televisual stimulation was definitely exciting.  Id like to comment on Movielink , the new studio-approved online movie rental service, but unfortunately this is all I am able to see:  Sign # CNN needs some sense slapped into them: its the day after an election, Republicans have taken control the Senate, Dick Gephardt is stepping down as House minority leader and right now, on Larry King, they are talking about the Winona Ryder verdict. At least they took down the BREAKING NEWS graphic.  there is a new trailer for Steven Soderberghs Solaris up today -- one of the movies I am most looking forward this fall. I got a copy of the great DVD release of Tarkovskys original film from The Russian Cinema Council a short while ago. Which I hope to review for Mindjack before the new films released.  Cory Doctorow reviews Smart Mobs in the new Mindjack: Smart Mobs are the Slashdot effect applied to the meatspace zeitgeist. A squillion like-minded souls who do not know each other and will never meet pop out of the transmetropolitan brickface and break the white-noise balance of atomic viewpoints to speak with one voice, roaring a righteous YES or an adamant NO without organizers, without leaders, without manifestoes or forethought. Also this issue, an in-depth look at the Internet Archive by Doug Roberts. Tucked away in one of the seediest neighborhoods of San Francisco is a roomful of over two hundred computers with a terabyte of data stored on every three. Stairs from the street lead up an intimidating hallway that opens into a room with -foot ceilings and just-this-side of hip ductwork in the ceiling. To the right is a storage area with a single desk, to the left are Bakers racks tightly packed with off-the-shelf HP desktop machines, each turned on its side to maximize the space. Somewhere in all that ductwork, a fan is squeaking painfully. Walking into this echoey, over-warm warehouse space, its easy to be underwhelmed until you realize what you are looking at: spinning away on these computers is nothing less than a copy of the Internet from  until today.  Mindjack is back after a short break. The new issue has a report on the Supernova conference by Doug Roberts. Supernova  was an ambitious conference and Kevin Warbach, the organizer along with pulver.com, acknowledged that from the outset when he said that he had crammed a three day conference into two days. The conference was touted as a glimpse into the decentralized future. Decentralized systems, as may be obvious, are systems that have no single point of control - the Internet is a perfect example. No one entity or agency controls it, no single server provides the service, and no single point of failure will bring down the system. Warbach sees these types of systems as the fundamental issue in computing for the next decade. By then end of day one, however, it became clear that the conference was going to be about one thing: blogging.  I just discovered through Smartmobs.com that Clive Thompson has a blog . Its great. Which reminds me, I really need to update the blogroll on this site.  Doug Roberts is covering Supernova for Mindjack and blogging it live .  Sometimes Amazon.com is just plain eerie.  If you are going to be in Los Angeles on , do not miss Live from the Blogosphere , a panel discussion to be put on by Rhizome.LA and moderated by Xeni Jardin. \"Live from the Blogosphere!\" brings together six innovators in blogging: Mark Frauenfelder, Heather Havrilesky, Evan Williams, Susannah Breslin, Doc Searls, and Tony Pierce. The panel will discuss the birth of blogging, the emergent tension between blogs and traditional journalism, innovations in blogging such as video-blogging, audio-blogging, and mobile-blogging, the shifting roles of race and gender in the Blogosphere, the state of the blog economy, and the way blogs may be reshaping contemporary media. (cross-posted from Daily Relay )  I review a cool laptop bag today in Daily Relay .  Douglas Rushkoff meets Al Gore and is suitably impressed . He was a much brighter, open-minded, and - if I might add - cosmic thinker than I gave him credit for, before. I felt like he was really one of \"us,\" if you know what I mean: the kids in college who got those wild thoughts about how everything in the world, and even beyond, is connected somehow. And evolving. Only Gore found this organic view of reality reflected in the Constitution of the United States, and sought to enable the extension of this Enlightenment thinking into practical reality.  New Mindjack up today! Cory Doctorow on William Gibson . Justin Hall on Super Monkey Ball  .  Check out this preview of Warren Ellis and Colleen Dorans new graphic novel, Orbiter .  Ah crap. Shift magazine publishes its last issue . Shift has pulled out from dire situations before, but this looks to be the end, which is a real shame. they have been a consistently great magazine and an important voice in the ever-changing sphere of digital culture. The final issue is due out in two weeks, I urge everyone to pick up a copy.  Mindjacks been slashdotted .  The Fray redesigned for the first time in over six years. Blog coming soon.  Deepsky have posted their remix of David Bowies \"I Took a Trip an a Gemini Spaceship\" on their website. Not as good as the original, but worth a listen. RealAudio link  This post by Warren Ellis to his blog is not just cool because he linked to Mindjack: At Bruce Sterlings house in Austin, Texas, Howard Waldrop beams Cory Doctorow an mp of some swampy old rocknroll from the dawn of time. The next day, across town, his powerbook scorching the flesh off his legs, he beams it over to me in England. I put it up on a private server for Fraction in Kansas City and Laurenn in San Francisco, while reading the first few chapters of Corys new book, which he sent to me from an airport a few days before, squatting by the power outlet next to the public toilets. continued...  Slashdot launches games.slashdot.org and, holy cow, its ugly.  Mindjack contributor and game reviewer, Justin Hall, has written a great article on ethics in video game journalism for the Online Journalism Review. The first print magazine covering video games Electronic Games was co-founded by Bill Kunkel in . Kunkel describes those early days in a recent interview: “To an extent, we were cheerleaders for the industry -- we loved these games, we wanted to see more of them, we wanted to keep writing about them.” Not much has changed in the past  years. Game publications and Web sites still mostly employ low-paid hobbyists who are easy targets of lavish marketing events that encourage inappropriate ties between game makers and game critics.  This is incredible. Scientists have discovered a \"Colossal\" squid in the Antartic, much bigger than the previous biggest giant squid found. And its not even fully grown. Deep sea exploration is nearly as fascinating to me as space exploration. Just imagine that there is something like this that no one has ever seen alive. Its interesting that the article notes the funding for the research is from the Discovery Channel. While its great there is some funding available, just as with space exploration, there should be much more.  Googling for sites that mention Mindjack, other than mindjack.com, suprisingly results in , links. I like the description on this one . Mindjack Magazine. One pusle showing the osmotic swelling of Digital culture as the norm.  New Mindjack up today. Josh examines the online, interconnected groups of people that you turn to for advice on music, art, fashion, books, etc., and the broader implications of these taste tribes. Also, Justin Hall reviews Panzer Dragoon Orta for Xbox. The illustration, btw, is by Matt Hinrichs , who will hopefully be doing semi-regular ones for us.  I review Soul Calibur , Syberia, and Post Mortem in the new Mindjack.  Via scrubbles.net : a (nearly) complete index of Alfred Hitchcocks cameos .  My article, Reunderstanding Movies , about how DVDs and the Internet are changing the way we watch movies, is in the new Mindjack .  I have started a film blog: melanson.ca/movies . No promises on how often I will post to it, but I try to do as many reviews as I can.  For your linking pleasure, a new Mindjack ad. More sizes coming soon.  I have been blogging more at Mindjacks Daily Relay lately and hope to be able to keep it up. we have got lots of good stuff coming up in Mindjack in the next few months, so keep your eye on the blog for further updates.  Apparently from a sidewalk in Austin.  Derek Powazeks comment over in this entry at Blackbeltjones reminded me of Amazon.coms incredibly good Friends & Favorites area. Mr. Bezos, if you are reading this, please add this to Amazon.ca . Canadians have friends too.  I have been playing around with Flickr lately, the latest toy from the mad geniuses at Ludicorp . You can find my Flickr profile here . I have also started a Mindjack group as a bit of an experiment. If it works out I may try to integrate it into the site.  Now in Mindjack: Is Nothing Sacred? Digital Music for a Digital Age by Ian Dawe. Antero Allis Hysteria reviewed on DVD by Jesse Walker.  _img Originally uploaded by QuizMaster . Posted by Don Melanson from Flickr .  The new issue of Mindjack is now online . In this issue: Linked Out: blogging, equality and the future by Melanie McBride. Plus Kill Bill Vol.  reviewed by Jesse Walker.  there is a new issue of Mindjack now online. In it, the first article from Mindjacks newest contributor J.D. Lasica; he writes about copyright law in \"The Killing Fields\" . Also, I review DVDs of Breathless, Russian Ark, and Z . Spread the word.  \"An idea is a funny thing. It does nothing unless you do.\"  I am looking for someone to be Advertising Director for Mindjack. Must have advertising sales experience and be willing to work on commission. This is a contract job that can be done from home. If you are interested, please email: donald@mindjack.com (no attachments). Also, were constantly looking for great new writers. If you want to write for us, drop an email.  I am pleased to announce that VRML creator and all-around visionary Mark Pesce has joined Mindjacks ever-growing stable of writers. His first article, Redefining Television , is an insightful examination of the state and future of the medium. Heres a snippet: In the earliest days of television, writers like George Orwell in  and Ray Bradbury in Fahrenheit  projected television as the instrumentality of a totalitarian future - a monolithic entity dispensing propaganda. And, if any of you occasionally watch Fox News, you can see they were not that far off the mark. But heres the thing: the monolithic days of television are numbered. Actually, they have already passed - though, as yet, very few people realize this. To understand why, we need to go back to first principles. What is television? Heres a functional definition: Television is the capture, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display of moving images. This definition applies to the Golden Age of television, and to the present era. Yet the definition of every word in the definition of television has changed, because of the introduction of digital production, encoding, transmission, reception, decoding and display technologies.  I am using this blog to play around with Bloggers new features . It will return to normal shortly.  I am blogging a lot more on my film blog than I am here. If you like movies, check it out. And, of course, I continue to write and blog at Mindjack .'"
