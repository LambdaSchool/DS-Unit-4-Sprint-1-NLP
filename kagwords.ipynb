What wheated whiskeys gain in drinkability, they can lose in vibrancy and zest.

The cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place, with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time), along with linden blossom, cream, green jasmine tea, and mint.

With a little water, more subtle flavors are revealed, including toffee, dark fruit, and anise. The whisky finishes long and dry with significant depth.

The main theme to this whiskey is lush toffee sweetness and, like last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expression, some vanilla fudge, nougat, and molasses.

Exotic tropical fruit aromas (citrus, melon, coconut), with interwoven notes of almonds, pear, honey, and subtle peat smoke. Light to medium in body, and very delicate in nature. On the palate, the whisky begins sweet (especially honey), followed by a basket of exotic fruit and nuts similar to its aroma, becoming drier and distantly smoky on the finish. This Bowmore Fino Cask, a whisky which has aged very well indeed, is the first of three limited edition 1964 vintage Bowmore whiskies to be released over the next year.

It shows bright fruit (lemon, caramelized pineapple, tangerine), honeyed vanilla, and marzipan with a peppering of cinnamon and ginger. Perhaps the 1994 as an aperitif, and the 1998 a digestif? The 1998 is not nearly as post-prandial as, say, the 1972 vintage, but it has more weight than the 1994 vintage.

On the palate it is all over the place with raw oak, cinnamon, almond, and black pepper. There\\'s no balance and no integration. The finish is short, hot, and dry. As whiskey ages, it goes through odd, awkward phases, and that\\'s where this one is.\",48.0,72,44.0,3.0\\n4128,Geoffrey Kleinman,\"Many moonshine products are centered around corn, but Freedom Moonshine mixes it up with a mashbill of 95% rye and 5% malted barley. Yeasty rye bread defines the nose with an undercurrent of white grape. The entry is soft, with yeasty rye, vanilla, and bran flakes. There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some structure in the mid-palate with rye spice and black pepper but it needs more. The finish is a little flat, all pointing to the need for a slightly higher proof.\",20.0,72,40.0,3.0\\n4129,John Hansell,\"Perhaps my least favorite of all the Experimental Collection releases to date. The nose shows nicely, but it comes across as rather aggressive and harsh on the palate toward the finish, which the label describes as being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cearthy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Otherwise, the whiskey is pleasantly sweet, with molasses, date, and fig, plus charcoal, leather, and bitter resin in the mix. Price is per 375 ml.\",46.0,72,45.0,2.0\\n4131,John Hansell,\"Origins is Benromach\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new program to highlight different aspects of whisky-making, which I think is a great idea. This expression focuses on the use of Golden Promise barley to make the malt, which is then aged in a sherry cask. Unfortunately, there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s so much sherry here that I struggle to appreciate the impact or distinction from the Golden Promise barley. Notes of ripe orchard fruit, tangerine, beeswax, sticky toffee pudding, and toasted almond. Lingering smoke and waxed fruit stays through to the finish. A weighty Benromach (from the Golden Promise and/or the sherry). I find the nose pleasant enough, but the sherry-induced waxed fruit component that emerges mid-palate is just too dominant.\",85.0,72,50.0,1.0\\n4132,John Hansell,\"Quite pale in color. Very youthful and naked, with damp peat, leafy smoke, charred oak, and black licorice, pears in honey and vanilla-tinged barley. Quite an eye-opener for a non-Islay whisky. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a little green and ornery. Certainly an entertaining whisky, but a few more years in the barrel would round this whisky out, meld the flavors together, and add depth.\",60.0,72,45.0,1.0\\n4133,John Hansell,\"Youthful, and somewhat brooding for a Tomintoul. I can tell there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s some young whisky in here, as there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a suggestion of new make spirit interwoven with notes of heather, ripe barley, raw peat, and lingering smoke. I like the concept, but wish the young component (the peated part of this whisky?) was matured a bit longer.\",45.0,72,40.0,1.0\\n4136,Geoffrey Kleinman,\"The nose starts with sweet corn, cornmeal, yeasty bread, and black pepper, with wet dog and a slight varnishy note right behind. The entry is soft and round, with dry cornmeal, bran flakes, and yeasty bread. Unfortunately, the varnish note from the nose returns pretty clearly in the mid-palate along with black pepper. Everything wraps up with a shorter than expected finish. The heart of this whiskey is interesting, but it could benefit from a much tighter cut. (distillery store only)\",30.0,71,50.0,3.0\\n4138,John Hansell,\"A big bourbon in many respects, but this is one whiskey where I would have happily settled for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSingle Barreled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I tasted this whiskey straight from the barrel right before it was bottled and it was more aggressive; I think the lower strength and chill-filtering has helped to tame this beast. To be honest, there are some good qualities to this whiskey. The nose is wonderful! Even the palate starts out fine, with chewy toffee, molasses, dark fruit, raisins, and dates. But it is quickly consumed by intensely dry oak spice, gripping resin, and leather, which clings to my tongue and won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t let go. In this instance, last impressions are lasting impressions. Price is per 375 ml.\",47.0,71,45.0,2.0\\n4139,John Hansell,\"Aged in a sherry cask, which adds sweet notes of toffee, Caribbean rum, waxed fruit, red licorice, and fruitcake to go along with the earthy smoke and lingering peat. A much sweeter, fruitier affair than the Croftengea also reviewed here, but behind all that sherry there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a whisky that needs a little more maturing.\",60.0,71,45.0,1.0\\n4140,Davin de Kergommeaux,\"Traces of burnt caramel add interest to an otherwise simple, overly sweet palate. A triumvirate of alcohol, chocolate toffee, and pepper. A slight bitterness is more distracting than pleasing or refreshing. Reminiscent of Aunt Jemima pancake syrup, Sailboat is just too sweet to sip solo, but adding ginger ale increases the complexity, as spirit and sweetness mingle with ginger and carbonation. It would benefit from a bit more wood. A very inexpensive whisky, though not a bargain.\\xc2\\xa0$20 CAD\",15.0,70,40.0,4.0\\n4143,Lew Bryson,\"Clear, slight golden hue; as expected from a 7% straight whiskey/93% grain neutral spirit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspirit whiskey.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Faint nose of sweet caramel corn in a hot bloom of estery alcohol. Thickly sweet in the mouth, with barely a hint of whiskey, like a badly-made cocktail or an ill-conceived flavored vodka. While there are no glaring flaws in the make, this is simply a bad idea. Light whiskey failed once, in the 1970s, and for good reasons.

And I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not crazy about the quality of the sherry (or perhaps even the wood it was aged in). I have great respect for both Highland Park and Binny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s, but this is somewhat disappointing for a Highland Park. Tasted twice, with the same opinion.

Its unctuous artificial flavors are equally unsuitable for cocktails, mixing, or sipping. Fruity, winey, lavender notes duke it out with baby cereal and artificial coconut. The saving graces?

Its short time in wood shows. No traditional notes of bourbon sweetness, not even an earthy hint of wood found in many younger bourbons.
