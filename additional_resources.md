I really like the DIY Projects and Datasets section towards the bottom of this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-get-started-in-nlp-6a62aa4eaeff
That would be a great todo-list of projects to build up a really solid NLP Portfolio. You'll notice that we've already done some of them.

This old Coursera course from Dan Jurafsky and Chris Manning is highly recommended https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXpZnZM63Gg&list=PL8FFE3F391203C98C as is Chris Manning's textbook (for those who like physical books) https://www.amazon.com/dp/0262133601/?tag=stackoverfl08-20

I like courses that will have you get into combining some of these topics with Neural Networks / Deep Learning and this Stanford Course seems to be a great resource for that http://cs224d.stanford.edu/syllabus.html Youtube playlist of the lectures for this course can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQQ-W_63UgQ&list=PL3FW7Lu3i5Jsnh1rnUwq_TcylNr7EkRe6

Also this Coursera course, because it seems to get beyond the basics fairly quickly: https://www.coursera.org/learn/language-processing

I also think that researching and familiarizing yourself with the most common and modern approaches (kind of what this week has been about) is also a sensible thing to do. https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-solve-90-of-nlp-problems-a-step-by-step-guide-fda605278e4e (edited)
